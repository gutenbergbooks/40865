<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><i>T was the author&#8217;s original intention to let this book make shift
without the conventional preface, as befitted the unconventionality
of its theme. But he has learned since it was begun&mdash;what
it was very stupid of him not to have known at the outset&mdash;that in
the matter of heresies, ethical, social, and political as well as theological,
interest is bound to pass for approval, explanation for
advocacy, and sympathy, be it ever so slight, for profound belief:
as if a man who showed a curiosity about and appreciation of dogs
should, by that very fact, become a dog; or as if (since there may
seem to be an unfortunate implication of contempt in this illustration)
a German who attempted to expound honestly English temperament,
opinions, and traditions should, by that very fact, become an
Englishman.</i></p>

<p><i>Once for all, then, the author is not a</i> revolutionist, <i>though there
are moments when he fancies he would like to be one, it appears
such an eminently satisfying state. It takes faith to be a revolutionist;
and he is, alas! mentally incapable of faith. He is
not an anarchist, not a socialist, not a radical, not a &#8220;red republican,&#8221;
nor a</i> &#8220;mangeur de pr&ecirc;tres.&#8221; <i>His affiliations have not
been even</i> Dreyfusard <i>in France, nor even Bryanite in America.
He is a conservative of the conservatives, only prevented from being
a reactionary by the fact that reaction is but another form of revolution,
and the most hopeless and faith-exacting of them all. So
far from being a revolutionist, he is an evolutionist only under
protest</i>,&mdash;vi et armis, <i>as it were. He favours things as they are,
things as they were quite as often, while things as they might be
contain for him no allure. He cherishes enormously this imperfect
old world as it is, still more as it was; has not the slightest desire
to reconstruct it after his own formula, and would not willingly
exchange it for any hypothetical world which, up to the present
hour, restless human ingenuity has devised.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span></p>

<p><i>He is &#8220;naturally beforehand shy of novelties, new books, new
faces, new years,&#8221; and is &#8220;sanguine only in the prospects of other
[former] years.&#8221; He likes old cabinets, old comedies, old prints,
old stuffs, old pipes, old wine, old ships, old trees, old shoes, old
friends, old customs, old crotchets, and old ladies.</i></p>

<p><i>He prefers infinitely&mdash;it is very wrong and foolish, perhaps,
but he cannot help it&mdash;ancient hostelries to modern hotels, spontaneous
neighbourliness to organised benevolence, fireplaces to
furnace-heaters, and waving meadows to close-cropped lawns; a
blooded aristocrat to a social struggler, a patriot to a cosmopolite,
a brave drinker to a total abstinence apostle, an illiterate Breton
peasant to the &#8220;smart&#8221; product of improved schools, a medi&aelig;val
cloister to a free-thinker&#8217;s hall, and an easy-going priest
to a nervous sceptic; beauty to utility, superstition to science, ritual
to plain sense. A uniform appeals to him more than a business
suit, a coquettish gown more than the most advanced hygienic
bloomer, a solicitous mother and competent housewife more than
a brilliant club woman. He finds more satisfaction in old-fashioned,
comfortable ideas than in disquieting progressive ones.
He would quite as soon be domineered over by a noble as by a parvenu
or a pot-house politician, and is less shocked by the colossal
pretensions of a pope than by the puerile bumptiousness of a
small-minded
clergyman. He deplores railways, trolleys, bicycles, automobiles,
and compulsory education, because they all tend to destroy
native dialects, customs, and costumes, obliterate all local
colour, and so render lands far separated dully alike. He resents
the presumptuousness of that Reason which is so seldom reasonable,
and would not shed a tear nor distil a regret if telephones,
telegraphs, and psychical research were swept off the face of the
earth.</i></p>

<p><i>He is well aware, therefore, that there is good to be said of time-honoured
institutions: of the state; of the army, the church, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
courts of law, the props of the state; and of capitalists, the pets
and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of the state. On occasion he could write a fervid
defence of each and every one of these established things. But he
is equally aware that there is good to be said of the conscientious
opponents of the state, its props and its prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. To say this
good is his present business; and, if he seems to bend over backward
sometimes in saying it, it should be borne in mind that they
also have bent over backward&mdash;nay, turned double somersaults
backward&mdash;who, prompted by terror, prejudice, intolerance, hatred,
or contempt, have pronounced unqualified condemnation on the
consecrated antagonists of things as they are; and it should at least
be queried whether his indiscretions may not be excused (if not
altogether justified) thereby.</i></p>

<p><i>No, the author is not a revolutionist, but he is acquainted with
plenty of good fellows who are. &#8220;He has eaten their bread and
salt; he has drunk their water and wine.&#8221; He has taken pot-luck
with them, witnessed their privations, and listened to the telling of
their dreams. He thinks he comprehends them, he knows he
loves them, and he would present them as he has found them to the
world.</i></p>

<p><i>This attitude will be understood by all who really believe in
fair play, in giving every man his innings and the devil his due;
who can admit merits equally in Christians and Pagans, Jesuits and
Agnostics, Classicists and Romanticists, Greeks and Goths;
who admire a beau geste alike in missionary and filibuster, condottiere
and crusader, martyr and toreador, pirate and king,&mdash;in
a Jeanne d&#8217;Arc and a Ravaillac, a Kitchener and a Joubert, a
Sheridan and a Mosby, a Dewey and an Aguinaldo, a Hobson
and a Cervera, a Makaroff and a Uryu, a Napoleon and a
Musolino, a Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion and a Robin Hood, a Nelson
and a Cambronne. It will be understood by all those who appreciate
a joke, even when it turns against themselves; who recognise the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
nobility of straight thinking and bold speaking, the sublimity of
high passion, the regenerating force of righteous resentment and
stubborn resistance, and the holiness of self-sacrifice for an ideal; who
have a faculty for putting themselves in other men&#8217;s places or have
learned the hard lesson of calling no thing &#8220;common or unclean&#8221;;

<p><span class="dropcap3">&#8220;</span><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HERE is nothing new under the sun,&#8221; and anarchism is
no exception to the truth of this maxim. But the beginnings
of anarchistic philosophy and the development
of anarchism, however suggestive they may be, do not fall within
the province of this volume. Therefore it is not necessary to expound
the tenets or to trace the influence of the anarchist or semi-anarchist
devotees through the ages: the Taoists of China (whose
founder, Lao-Tse (600 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), was a contemporary of Pythagoras
and Confucius), the social prophets of Islam from Mazdak in
the sixth century to the wonderful Bab in the first half of the
nineteenth century, Saint Anthony of Padua and Jean Vicenza
in the thirteenth century, Savonarola at the end of the fifteenth,
the Anabaptists under Thomas Munzer, Mathiesen, and Jean
de Leyde in the sixteenth, Razine the Cossack and the Scottish
Covenanters in the seventeenth, Mandrin the brigand in the
eighteenth, and the Jesuits of Paraguay in the last half of the
eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. I do not
pretend to determine whether the Guelph-Ghibelline feud, which
rent Europe for more than two hundred years, was or was not a
struggle between despotism and religious democracy, or whether
Gregory VII., Alexander III., Gregory IX., Innocent IV., and
Boniface VIII. were or were not revolutionary popes endeavouring
to realise the social dreams of the Franciscans and Dominicans.
I do not try to discover what there is of truth in the
astonishing claims of certain exalted students of occultism, mysticism,
and comparative religions, that anarchism found expression
in the worship of the Indian Siva, the Persian Mithras,
the Chaldean Baal-Moloch, and the Greek Bacchus; in the
conspiracy of the Bacchanals (described by Livy) in the first
half of the second century before Christ; in the colossal extravagances
of the C&aelig;sars; in the <i>bizarreries</i> of the Nicolaites,
the Cainites, the Carpocratians, the Ophites, and other Gnostics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of Egypt during the first five centuries of the Christian era; in the
<i>Consortia</i> under Constantine; and in the fanaticisms of the Inquisitors,
the Lollards, Flagellants, B&eacute;gards, Patarins, Templars,
and Devil-worshippers during the Middle Ages. I do not dwell
upon nor so much as collate the anarchistic tendencies and sanctions
which anarchist scholars discern in the writings or sayings of
Job and the Old Testament prophets, of Athanasius, Chrysostom,
and Saint Francis of Assisi, Plato, Jesus, Rabelais, Bourdaloue,
and Bossuet, and the pre-Revolutionary Encyclopedists (especially
Diderot and Rousseau). I even pass by the far more
pertinent teachings, systems, personalities, and careers of the
admitted precursors of modern anarchism; of Max Stirner and
Fourier, of Proudhon, the father of modern anarchist doctrine,
and of &#8220;the mysterious Russian,&#8221; Bakounine, the father of the
modern anarchist party. I also pass by the agrarian revolt of
Gracchus Bab&oelig;uf (guillotined by Barras in 1797); the emergence
of the learned Russian Kropotkine, and of the Italians
Cafiero and Malatesta; the relations between French anarchism
and Russian nihilism; the struggle for Italian liberation; the
founding of the <i>Internationale</i> and of the <i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Jurasienne</i>;
the epic struggle for the control of the <i>Internationale</i> between Karl
Marx, representing authoritative centralisation, and Bakounine,
representing anti-authoritative federalism. I neglect, in a word,
the more than interesting history of the slow evolution of modern
anarchism, and coming directly, without further ado, to the
France of to-day, attack the questions,&mdash;What is anarchy?
What does the anarchist want? And how does he hope to get it?</p>

<p>Of the contemporary French Encyclopedists who are preparing,
or think they are preparing, the revolution of the twentieth
century, three are eminently fitted by their learning, by their
capacity for straight thinking and utterance, by their sense of
historical perspective, their power of keen analysis and bold synthesis,
by their breadth, their tolerance, their humanity, their
integrity, and their consecration, to answer these questions.
They are Pierre Kropotkine, Elis&eacute;e Reclus, and Jean Grave.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
But Kropotkine, while the author of such epoch-making works
as <i>La Conqu&ecirc;te du Pain, L&#8217;Anarchie: son Id&eacute;al</i>, and <i>Les Paroles
d&#8217;un R&eacute;volt&eacute;</i>, is a Russian, not a Frenchman, by birth and breeding,
and has been little in Paris of late; and Reclus<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> (one of
the most learned geographers of his time), though never far
away from the anarchist movement, is, by reason of his devotion
to his specialty, rarely in the thick of it. Besides, he has made
his home in Belgium for many years.</p>

<p>It is to Jean Grave, therefore, the youngest of the three, the
present editor of the journal <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i> and author of
<i>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Mourante</i>, <i>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Future</i>, <i>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; au Lendemain
de la R&eacute;volution</i>, <i>L&#8217;Individu et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>, and <i>L&#8217;Anarchie:
son But, ses Moyens</i>, that it seems best to confide the delicate
task of presenting the French anarchistic idea and ideal; and,
because I cannot trust myself to summarise without bias the
<i>credo</i> of a sect to which I do not belong, I quote in full the comprehensive
first chapter of his important doctrinal volume, <i>L&#8217;Anarchie:
son But, ses Moyens</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In spite of the fact that the idea of anarchy has emerged from
the obscurity in which men have attempted to stifle it, in spite
of the fact that to-day (thanks to persecution, thanks to laws of
exception such as are made in the worst monarchies) the words
&#8216;anarchy&#8217; and &#8216;anarchist&#8217; are unfamiliar to none, there are not
many who know exactly what anarchy is.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The intervention of the anarchists in the Dreyfus affair, where
they were much in evidence, had the effect of bringing them into
contact with bourgeois politicians, who knew absolutely nothing
about them; but anarchy did not come out into a clearer light
from this association.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchy, in the eyes of some, is robbery, assassination, bombs,
a return to savagery; anarchists are only house-breakers, loafers,
who would divide all wealth in order to be able to amuse themselves
with doing nothing.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In the eyes of others, anarchy is a sort of Utopia, of golden-age
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
dream which they readily grant to be very beautiful, but
a dream good at best to illustrate books of ethics or fantastic
social schemes with. The most kindly disposed regard anarchy
as a vague aspiration which they do not hesitate to recognise as
desirable for humanity to attain, but as so completely inaccessible
that there is no reason for making any decided effort to
realise it, and consider the anarchist as a species of lunatic whom
it is prudent to avoid, a pitiful <i>illumin&eacute;</i> who strays from the
practicable paths to lose himself in the vagueness of Utopia.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;They are very few who know that anarchy is a theory resting
on rational bases, that anarchists are men who, having collated
the complaints of those who suffer from the actual social
order, and having saturated themselves with human aspirations,
have undertaken a critique of the institutions which control us,
analysing them, weighing their worth, and estimating what they
are capable of producing, and who, from the sum total of their
observations, deduce logical natural laws for the organisation of
a better society.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Of course, the anarchists do not pretend to have invented the
critique of the social order. Others had done that before them.
As soon as power began to exist, there were malcontents who made
no bones of railing at its acts; and, if we possessed the legends
which men handed down from generation to generation before
writing was known, we should probably find therein satires against
the chiefs. It is quite possible to criticise the existing order of
things without being an anarchist, and there are those who
have done this in a successful fashion which the anarchists will
never surpass.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But what anarchists believe they have done more than the
other critics, more than the existing socialistic schools or the
socialistic schools which preceded them, is to have gotten their
bearings in the midst of the confused mass of errors which spring
from the complexity of social relations, to have remounted to the
causes of misery, of exploitation, and finally to have laid bare
the political error which made men place hope in good govern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>ments,
good governors, good legislation, good dispensers of justice,
as efficacious remedies for the ills from which humanity suffers.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchy, studying man in his nature, in his evolution, demonstrates
that there cannot be good laws or good governments
or faithful appliers of the laws.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Every human law is necessarily arbitrary; for, however just
it may be, and whatever may be the breadth of view of those who
make it, it represents only a part of human development, only
an infinitesimal fragment of the aspirations of all. Every law
formulated by a parliament, far from being the product of a great
conception, is, on the contrary, only the mean of public opinion,
since parliament itself, by its very manner of recruitment, represents
only a very mediocre mean.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Applied to all in the same fashion, the law becomes thus,
by the very force of things, arbitrary and unjust for those who
are on this side or on that side of the mean.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A law, then, not being able to represent the aspirations of all,
can be made effective on those who would infringe it only by fear
of punishment. Its application involves the existence of a judicial
and repressive apparatus, and it becomes thus the more
odious as its coercive force is the more sure.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The law unjust to start with, because, conception of minority
or majority, it wishes to impose itself on the whole, becomes
still more unjust because applied by men who, having the defects
and the passions, the prejudices and the personal errors, of appreciation
of men, cannot act, whatever be their probity, except under
the influence of these prejudices and errors.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;There can be no good laws, nor good judges, nor, consequently,
good government, since the existence of these implies a single
rule of conduct for all, while it is diversity which characterises
individuals.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;No society based on human laws, then,&mdash;and this is the case
of all societies past and present,&mdash;can fully satisfy the ideal of
every one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The minority of idlers alone who, by ruse and by force, have
managed to seize the power, and who use, to their own profit,
the forces of the collectivity,&mdash;this minority alone, I say, can find
their account in this order of things and interest themselves in
its prolongation. But they can only make it last with the help of
the ignorance of individuals regarding their own personalities,
their possibilities, and their capacities.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But however great the ignorance of the people may be, when
the pressure is too strong, they revolt. This is why our society
is so unstable, why the laws are repeatedly violated by those
who make them or by those who are charged to apply them,
when their interest points that way; for, power being based on
force, it is to force that all those resort who are in power and wish
to maintain themselves there, as well as all those who are in pursuit
of power.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Made to be applied to all and to content everybody, the laws
derange more or less every individual, who wishes, while he is
under them, to abolish or relax them, but who wishes them more
vigorous when it is his turn to apply them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Nevertheless, new aspirations do arise; and, when the antagonism
becomes too great between these aspirations and the political
laws, the door opens wide to disorders and to revolution.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And it will always be the same so long as no other way is
found to repair the harm done by a law recognised as bad than
the application of a new law. This ignorance on the part of men
makes human institutions, once established, resist changes. The
names vary, but the things remain.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Men, not having yet been able to arrive at a social conception
other than that of authority, are condemned to turn in the same
circle, and will be condemned to turn in the same circle so long
as they shall not have altered their conception. Royalty, empire,
dictatorship, republic, centralisation, federalism, communalism,&mdash;these
are all at bottom so many phases of authority.
Whether in the name of a single person or in the deceitful name
of the majority, always the will of some is imposed on all.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Furthermore, if the individual increases his knowledge in
a continuous fashion, it is only in a very slow fashion. Still he
has arrived to-day at the point where, to develop himself in his
integrity, it is necessary that his autonomy be complete, that his
aspirations express themselves freely, that he be permitted to
cultivate them in all their breadth, that nothing fetter his free
initiative and his evolution.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And so it is that now, at last, anarchists draw from their
study of the existing social organisation this important lesson:
that human laws ought to disappear, carrying with them the
legislative, executive, judicial, and repressive systems which
impede human evolution by causing murderous crises in which
many thousands of human beings perish, by delaying all humanity
in its forward march, and, sometimes, even by dragging it
backward.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;While the politicians have not got beyond this formula, which
they believe the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of liberty,&mdash;&#8216;<i>l&#8217;individu libre dans
la commune, la commune libre dans l&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>,&#8217;&mdash;we know that these
political forms are incompatible with liberty, since they tend
always to submit a number of men to the same rule; and we formulate
our device, &#8216;<i>l&#8217;individu libre dans l&#8217;humanit&eacute; libre</i>,&#8217;&mdash;the
individual, left free to attach himself according to his tendencies,
his affinities, free to seek out those with whom his liberty and
his aptitudes can accord, unfettered by the political organisations
which are determined by geographical or territorial considerations.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;For man to develop himself freely in his physical, intellectual,
and moral nature, for him to reveal all his capacities, it is necessary
that each individual be able to satisfy all his physical, intellectual,
and moral needs. And this satisfaction can only be
assured to all if the soil, which is the creation of no one, is placed
at the free disposition of whoever is capable of tilling it, and if
the existing equipment, product of the labour of preceding generations,
ceases to belong to a minority of parasites who exact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
a large tithe upon the resultant of its activity and the activity
of those who work it.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The earth too much cut up, on the one hand, to permit the
small land-holders to employ the powerful machinery which
would effectively second their efforts, appropriated in immense
lots, on the other hand, by a class of idlers who secure, without
work, an income from the production of those to whom they
consent to rent,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>&mdash;the earth nourishes its existing population
with difficulty. And I have not counted the ignorance which is
fostered by a defective education and which causes the greater
part of the cultivators to cling to the traditional processes of
cultivation,&mdash;processes which demand far too much work and
effort for the results.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Yet, in spite of these sources of waste, the earth would still
manage to nourish, after a fashion, every living being if the
middlemen were not there to warehouse the products and to
speculate and gamble upon them, in such a way that the majority
of persons are never in a condition to buy what they need.
The fault, then, if all have not enough to eat, lies with the defective
social organisation, and is not due to lack of production.
A better distribution of products would alone be sufficient to give
every one enough to eat, while a better management of the soil
and a better use of the instruments of production would bring
about abundance for all.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A clearer comprehension of things will bring the peasant
to understand that his interest, properly understood, is to unite
his parcel of land with the parcels of his neighbours, to associate
his efforts with their efforts, in order to diminish his toil and increase
his production.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And as no one has the right to sterilise, for his sole pleasure,
the slightest parcel of land, so long as there is a single being who
has not plenty to eat, the coming revolution will have for one
of its objects to put the soil into the hands of those who shall wish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to cultivate it and the farm machines into the hands of those who
shall wish to operate them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;All this, anarchy seeks to demonstrate to the peasant, explaining
to him that the masters who impose upon him exploit
likewise the workman of the towns, trying to make him comprehend
that, far from considering the town workman as an enemy,
he should stretch out his hand to him, to the end that they may
aid each other in the struggle for life, and arrive thus at disembarrassing
themselves of their common parasites.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To the workman, anarchy demonstrates that he must not
expect his enfranchisement to come from providential saviours,
nor from the palliatives with which the puppets of politics, who
wish to control his vote and so dominate him, try to dazzle him;
that the emancipation of the individual can be brought about
only by the individual&#8217;s own action, can result only from his
own energy and his own efforts when, knowing how to act, he
shall use his liberty in place of demanding it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;It is not alone to those who are dying of want that anarchy
addresses itself. To satisfy one&#8217;s hunger is a primordial right
which takes precedence over all other rights and stands at the
head of the claims of a human being. But anarchy embraces
all the aspirations and neglects no need. The list of its demands
includes all the demands of humanity.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Mirbeau, in his <i>Mauvais Bergers</i>, makes one of the characters
proclaim to workmen on a strike their right to beauty. And,
indeed, every being has a right not only to what sustains life, but
also to whatever renders it easy, enlivens it, and embellishes it.
They are rare, alas! in our social state, who can live their lives
amply.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Some there are whose physical needs are satisfied, but who
are retarded in their evolution by a social organisation which is
conditioned by the narrowness of conception of the average intellect,&mdash;artists,
litt&eacute;rateurs, savants, all who think, suffer morally,
if not physically, from the present order of things.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Daily they are wounded by the pettinesses of current existence,
and disheartened by the mediocrity of the public to whom they
address themselves, and whom they must consider if they wish
to sell their works,&mdash;a situation which conducts those who would
not die of hunger to compromise, to vulgar and mediocre art.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Their education has led many of them to believe that they
are of an essence superior to the peasant, to the manual worker,
from whom, for the matter of that, they are for the most part
descended. They have been persuaded that it is necessary, if
their &#8216;talent&#8217; is to develop and their imagination is to have full
swing, that the &#8216;vile multitude&#8217; take upon its shoulders the heavy
tasks, devote itself to serving them, and wear itself out in
making, by its labour, life easy for them; that they must have,
if their genius is to attain its complete fruition, the same atmosphere
of luxury and of idleness as the aristocratic classes.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A healthy conception of things teaches that a human being,
to be complete, must exercise his limbs as well as his brain, that
labour is degrading only because it has been made a sign of servitude,
and that a man truly worthy of the name does not need
to impose the cares of his existence on others.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;One man is as good as another: that there are degrees of development
is due to causes of which we are ignorant, but such or
such an illiterate may have moral qualities superior to the moral
qualities of those who are more learned than he. In any case, intelligence,
if it blesses him who possesses it, does not confer on him
the right to exploit or govern others. These differences of development
merely imply differences of desires, of aspirations,
of ideals; and it is for the individual himself who is so favoured
to realise what responds best to his conception of happiness.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Besides, these differences of development only appear to
us as great as they do because education, ill understood and ill
distributed, perpetuates prejudices and errors. Imagination, invention,
observation, judgment, if they vary somewhat in intensity
in different individuals, do not differ in essence. They are
simple faculties of our brain which do not lose their quality for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
being employed to construct a machine or a house, solder a kettle,
or make a shirt, rather than to write a romance or a treatise on
anatomy.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Greedy of hierarchy, we humans have divided into high and
low occupations the diverse employment of our forces. The
parasites who have made themselves our masters, all in proclaiming
themselves superior, have established that there is nothing
truly noble but idleness, that there is nothing truly beautiful
but force exerted to destroy; that force expended to produce,
to draw out of the earth and out of industry whatever is necessary
to sustain life, is of a vile, inferior quality, and that its use
should be reserved to the servile classes.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;On this basis we continue to declare certain occupations low,
forgetting that they are such only because one class is forced to
pursue them in the service of another class, to submit to its orders
and caprices, to abdicate its liberty; but there can be nothing
base in no matter what work which consists in ministering
to our own needs.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The artist and the litt&eacute;rateur belong to the masses. They
cannot isolate themselves, and inevitably feel the effects of the
surrounding mediocrity. It is vain for them to intrench themselves
behind the privileges of the ruling classes, to attempt to
withdraw into their &#8216;<i>tour d&#8217;ivoire</i>&#8217;: if there is debasement for him
who is reduced to performing the vilest tasks to satisfy his hunger,
the morality of those who condemn him to it is not superior to
his own; if obedience degrades, command, far from exalting
character, degrades it also.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To live their dream, realise their aspirations, they, too, must
work&mdash;for the moral and intellectual elevation of the masses.
They, too, must understand that their own development is made
up of the intellectuality of all; that, whatever the heights they
believe they have attained, they belong to the multitude. If
they strain to rise above the multitude, a thousand bonds hold
them to it, fetter their action and their thought, preventing them
forever from reaching the summits they have glimpsed. A society
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
normally constituted does not admit slaves, but a mutual
exchange of services between equals.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;The very savant, who considers dealing with knowledge the
noblest employ of the human faculties, must learn that knowledge
is not a private domain reserved for a few adepts uttering oracles
before a public of ignoramuses, who take them at their word;
and that in science, as in art and in literature, the faculties of
judgment, of observation, and of comparison, do not differ from
the faculties employed in occupations which we consider more
vulgar.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In spite of the intellectual compression which has held humanity
down for so many centuries, science has been able to
progress and develop, thanks to the critical spirit of individuals
refractory to official teaching and ready-made conceptions.
It ought, then, to be put within the reach of all, to become accessible
to all aptitudes, in order that this spirit of criticism which
has saved it from obscurantism may contribute to hasten its full
efflorescence.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Knowledge is divided into so many diverse branches that
it is impossible for the same individual to know them all in their
entirety, the duration of a human life being far from sufficient
for a man to acquire enough ideas to be able to investigate them
in their minutest details.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To study them,&mdash;that is, if he expects to be able to criticise
them,&mdash;he is forced to have recourse to the labours of his predecessors
and also of his contemporaries.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is from all human knowledge that the general synthesis
must proceed. What we know to-day is only a means for acquiring
the knowledge of to-morrow. And an individual obtains
reliable knowledge only in accepting the help of all. The
observations of the humblest persons are not always to be disdained.
Let the savants also, then, cease to believe themselves
a caste apart, let them understand once for all that knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
does not demand special aptitudes, and that it must be accessible
to all, in order that all, in developing themselves, may contribute
thus to the general development.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;What is true for individuals is true for nations. Just as an
individual cannot live without the support of all, a people cannot
exist without the co-operation of the other peoples. A nation
which should shut itself up within its frontiers, ceasing all relations
with the rest of the world, would not be slow to retrograde
and perish. It is then absurd and criminal to foment, under colour
of patriotism, hatreds nominally national, but which are in reality
only pretexts for the governing classes to legitimise the scourge,
militarism, of which they have need to assure their power.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Every nation has need of the other nations. There is not
a region which, for one product or another, is not the customer
of another region. And it is no reason for you to hate
your neighbours because they speak a different language, because
a hundred years ago they invaded and ravaged regions
which are indifferent to you to-day; and it is no reason for you
to feel yourselves outraged by this ancient invasion because,
once upon a time, the inhabitants of the invaded regions suffered
under the yoke which now galls you.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;There is not a single nation which cannot reproach its neighbours
with some crime of this sort; not a single nation which at the
present moment does not hold within its borders some province
incorporated against the desire of its inhabitants. And, if those
who performed these acts of brigandage were highly detestable,
in what respect are their descendants responsible therefor? Should
we also be held responsible for the acts of brigandage which our
histories teach us to admire as glorious achievements?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Who among those who aspire to live solely by their own work
can take delight in seeing one nation rush upon another nation?
It is only those who have made themselves the masters of nations,
and who find it for their interest to augment the numbers of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
whom they exploit, who feel the need of supplying aliment to the
troops they train for the work of slaughter. These understand
perfectly that a menace of war with a neighbour serves to justify
the existence of the armies which are their main prop.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The despots who have exalted patriotism into a new religion
know very well how to ignore frontiers when the defence of their
privileges or the extension of their exploitation is at stake. If
it is a question of hunting down subversive ideas, the French,
German, Italian, Swiss, Russian, and other bourgeois are ready
enough to lend to each other their diplomats and their police.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Is it a question of putting down a strike? The exploiters
are not slow to engage foreign workmen, so that they consent
to work at the lowest wage; and governments would not hesitate,
if there were need, to lend each other their armies.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And do not all the international understandings which have
been established for finance, the postal service, commerce, navigation,
railroads, prove that it is the <i>entente pacifique</i>, after all,
which is the supreme law?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The anarchists would bring the workers to see a brother in
every workingman, on whichever side of the frontier he chances
to have been born.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Brothers in misery, suffering from the same ills, bowed beneath
the same yoke, they have the same interests to defend, the same
ideal to pursue. Their veritable enemies are those who exploit
them, who enslave them and prevent their development. It
is against their masters that they should arm themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;Anarchy pays little attention to the shady combinations of
politics. It professes the most profound disdain for politicians.
The promises of the place-seekers interest it only as they disclose
all the inanity of politics, and only as they can be made use of
to demonstrate that the social organisation will not be transformed
until the day when a resolute attack shall be made against
its economic defects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If the politicians believe the lies they retail, they are simple
ignoramuses or imbeciles; for the slightest reasoning should
suffice to make them understand that, when a disease is to be
cured and its return prevented, its causes must be attacked. If
they lie purposely, they are rascals; and, in the one case as in the
other, they deceive those whose confidence they win by their
babble and their intrigue.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Those who exploit the actual economic organisation will
always seek to direct to their own profit all the attempts at amelioration
that are suggested, and there will always be people who
are dismayed by brusque changes and who prefer to rely on middle
terms which seem to them to conciliate all interests.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It will always be for the advantage of the masters to deceive
the oppressed regarding the veritable means of enfranchisement,
and there will always be enough cormorants greedy of power to
assist them in their work of muddling questions.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchy demonstrates the inanity of every attempt at amelioration
which attacks only the effect while letting subsist the cause.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;So long as the wealth of society shall be the appanage of a
minority of loafers, this minority will employ it in living at the
expense of those whom it exploits. And, as it is the possession
of capital which makes strength and gives the mastery of the
social organisation, they are always in a position to turn to their
own profit every amelioration which is undertaken.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;For an amelioration to benefit all, privileges must be destroyed.
It is to re-enter into the possession of that of which they have
been despoiled that the efforts of those who possess nothing ought
to tend. To break the power which crushes them, to prevent
its reconstitution, to take possession of the means of production,
to create a social organisation in which social wealth can no
more be concentrated in the hands of a few,&mdash;this is what the
anarchists dream.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If the exploitation of man is to be prevented, the bases of the
economic order must be changed: the soil and all that which is
the product of anterior generations must rest at the free disposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of those who can work them, must not be monopolised
for the gain of any party whatsoever,&mdash;individual, group, corporation,
commune, or nation.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This is what the partisans of partial reforms do not comprehend,
and yet this is what conscientious study of economic facts
demonstrates. Nothing good can come from the activity of
the charlatans of politics. Human emancipation cannot be the
work of any legislation, of any concession of liberty on the part
of those who rule. It can only be the work of the <i>fait accompli</i>,
of the individual will affirming itself in acts.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;Basing itself upon the evolutionist doctrine, rejecting all
preconceived will in the phenomena by which the evolution of
worlds and beings is manifested, recognising that this evolution
is solely the work of the forces of matter in contact, simply the
result of the transformations which this matter undergoes in
the course of its own evolution, anarchy is frankly atheistic,
and repels every idea of any creating or directing entity whatsoever.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But, as it is absolute liberty, if it combats religious error,
it is primarily from the point of view of truth, and, specifically,
because the priesthoods which have sprung up about the different
religious dogmas pretend to use the force which their
authority and capital lend them to impose their beliefs and to
make even those who reject all religions help pay for them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As to whatever concerns the intimate thought of each, anarchists
understand that an individual cannot think otherwise
than his own mentality permits. They would see no objection
to people gathering together in special buildings for the purpose
of addressing prayers and praises to a hypothetical being if they
did not attempt to impose their beliefs on others.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchists look for the triumph of reason from, and only

<p class="quote">&#8220;Like all the forms of human activity, the association of the
sexes has not to brook the control or solicit the sanction of any
person whatsoever. It is absurd to wish to set limits to, raise
barriers against, or impose restraints on the affections of individuals.
Love, friendship, hatred, do not come at call: we feel
them or endure them without being able to help ourselves, without
even, more often than not, being able to explain them and
unravel their motives.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Marriage, then, can be trammelled by no rule, by no law

no duration beyond the reciprocal affection of the two beings
associated, and should be dissoluble at the will of the party for
whom it becomes a burden.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;True, there will always remain some problems which cannot
be solved without friction and pain, such as the disposition of
the children, the suffering of the party in whom love survives,
and other matters of sentiment. But these difficulties cannot
be resolved any better by pre-established rules: on the contrary,
constraint only envenoms the difficulties. It will be the duty
of the interested parties to find the solution of the difficulties
which estrange them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The great objection behind which the adversaries of anarchy
intrench themselves when driven into their last redoubts is this,
that the anarchist ideal is beautiful, certainly, but much too beautiful
ever to be realised, since humanity will never be well-behaved
enough to attain it.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This objection is specious. No one can say what humanity
will be to-morrow; and there is no phase of its past development
which, if it had been foreseen and announced to the generations

as unrealisable as the anarchist ideal is held by those who cannot
abstract themselves from the present,&mdash;a mental state not hard
to understand, since the average brain has not yet accomplished
the evolution which will smooth the way for the new order of
things.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As long as individuals stagnate in servitude, waiting for
providential men or events to put an end to their abjectness, as
long as they shall be contented to hope without acting, so long

will rest, necessarily, in a state of pure reverie, of vague Utopia.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">A</span>NARCHIST propaganda is of four sorts, viz.: I. Oral. II.
Written. III. By example (<i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>).
IV. By the overt act of violence (<i>propagande par le fait</i>).</p>

<p>With the anarchistic as with other creeds the simplest, most
natural form of oral propaganda is, of course, that which consists
in telling one&#8217;s faith to one&#8217;s neighbour.</p>

<p>The proselyting zeal that prompts a man to take his gospel
with him wherever he goes,&mdash;to his workshop, to his caf&eacute;, to his
restaurant, to the street corner, to &#8220;the butcher, the baker, the
candlestick maker,&#8221;&mdash;and to couple with exhortation the</p>

</div>

<p>that make up neighbourly service, is a force not the less real and
potent because its operations are unseen and the measure of
them cannot be taken. It is a factor to be reckoned with, the</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;<i>presence of a good diffused,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in diffusion ever more intense</i>&#8221;;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>but it is essentially an affair of the soul not to be declared save
by the novelist or poet, and it is of the same substance in all cases
of genuine conviction, whatever the basis of the conviction may be.</p>

<p>The unit of the only oral propaganda of which the public can
take cognisance is the &#8220;group&#8221; (<i>le groupe</i>).</p>

<p>The anarchist group is unique&mdash;among organisations, one
would say if one might. Whether it consist of three persons or
thirty, or some number between these limits,&mdash;in point of fact
it is oftener three than thirty, with an average of perhaps a dozen,&mdash;it
has neither constitution nor by-laws, neither president, vice-president,
nor executive board. It is as exempt from human
guidance as a Quaker meeting, to which, for the matter of that,
it bears more than this one superficial resemblance, and as guiltless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
as an old-fashioned ladies&#8217; committee meeting of parliamentary
law. Now the <i>camarades</i> do not always conduct themselves
with exemplary decorum, and it sometimes happens that
two or three of them are on their feet together and talking at once;
but, at the most, this predicament does not arise more frequently
than in more rule-bound bodies, and it cannot, on the whole, be
said that the groups are any more disorderly, distrait, dilly-dallying,
and ineffective than the boresome assemblies in which, often,
conceited lack-brains make parliamentary tactics an end, not a
means, by perpetually &#8220;rising to points of order&#8221; and &#8220;appealing
from the decisions of the chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The group meets sometimes at a caf&eacute; or wine-shop and sometimes
at the lodging of a member. It is oftenest born of a mutual
desire for fellowship on the part of the anarchists of a street or
quarter; but it may result, quite independently of propinquity,
from a common enthusiasm for a special phase of the doctrine,
a common wish to pursue the same line of study, or from a common
interest in some concrete enterprise, such as coming to the
rescue of strikers, raising funds for the families of the victims of
police persecution, founding libraries and lecture courses, or the
circulation of tracts. In any case there are no formal conditions
of membership, a group never being at a loss to rid itself,
without appeal to written law or precedent, of an intruder who
makes himself obnoxious.</p>

<p>The programmes of group meetings vary infinitely with the
tempers and caprices of the members, as well as with the objects
of the groups; but they may be said, in general, to consist of the
reading of original essays and poems, reports on the progress of
the cause at home and abroad, a consideration of the bearing
on the cause of the latest events in the world at large, an exchange
of journals and brochures accompanied by expositions
and discussions of their contents, a volunteering of service for
the tasks in hand, and that untrammelled exchange of ideas
in which the lines between speech-making and conversation,
wrangle and discussion, are not too rigidly drawn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The group is highly ephemeral. Everything about it being
guided by the exigencies of the moment, it rarely survives the
accomplishment of the special object for which it is formed.
It dies, as it is born, easily; or, rather, yielding to the charm of
the untried, it takes to itself a new body when the old body grows
cramping or monotonous. Such deaths do not signify complete
exhaustion of vitality or even a diminution of strength. By
a sort of transmigration of souls the vital force is redistributed,
that is all.</p>

<p>This remarkable fluidity makes it practically impossible to
get any group statistics that are worth the paper they are written
on. An estimate made a few years back by a person who seemed
as well situated as any one to know, put the number of groups at
about one hundred in Paris and between four hundred and five
hundred in the rest of France. The same authority would probably
give rather higher figures now. But such figures, even if
accurate, are of very slight importance, since the number of
groups is no criterion whatever of the number of anarchists.
The most militant anarchists hold aloof from the groups in order
to have complete freedom of action and escape police surveillance;
many are in commercial or administrative situations which
counsel reticence; and many labourers are constrained to a similar
reticence by the danger of losing their jobs. Furthermore,
many anarchists call themselves socialists in order to benefit
by the greater tolerance accorded to the socialists, especially
since the Combes ministry came into power. In a word, the anarchist
has every reason to conceal his identity from the prying
statistician, and usually succeeds in doing so. Mark Twain,
commenting once on the inadequate census returns of the Jews
in America, affirmed that he himself was personally acquainted
with several million. The meagre numbers ordinarily assigned
to the anarchists in France tempt one strongly to imitate Mark&#8217;s
facetious audacity. At least, if French anarchists are really so
few, one may affirm with safety that he is personally acquainted
with them all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>Group names are of no great moment when group identity
is so evanescent; but some of the names are picturesque or suggestive
enough to bear recording:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Les Enfants de la Nature</i>, <i>La Panth&egrave;re de Batignolles</i>, <i>Les
Gonzes Poilus du Point-du-Jour</i>, <i>La Jeunesse Anti-Patriotique
de Belleville</i>, <i>Le Drapeau Noir</i>, <i>Les Quand M&ecirc;me</i>, <i>La R&eacute;volte des
Travailleurs</i>, <i>Le Cercle Internationale</i>, <i>La Torpille</i>, <i>Le Groupe
Libertaire</i>, <i>Les For&ccedil;ats</i>, <i>Le R&eacute;veil</i>, <i>Les R&eacute;solus</i>, <i>L&#8217;Emancipation</i>,
<i>Les Anti-Travailleurs</i>, <i>Les Indomptables</i>, <i>Les Sans-Patrie</i>,
<i>Les Amis de Ravachol</i>, <i>Les C&oelig;urs de Ch&ecirc;ne</i>, <i>La Dynamite</i>, <i>Terre
et Ind&eacute;pendance</i>, <i>Les Indign&eacute;s</i>, <i>La Vip&egrave;re</i>, <i>L&#8217;Affam&eacute;</i>, <i>Le Glaive</i>,
<i>Les Parias de Charonne.</i></p>

<p>As each individual of a group is a law unto himself, recognising
no authority in the group as a whole, so each group is a law unto
itself, independent of every other group and recognising no higher
authority whatsoever. In France, formerly, as is still the case
in several countries, groups of the same region formed a federation;
but the only present tangible proofs of the existence of an anarchist
movement on a large scale are district, national, and international
congresses to which whoever wishes<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> may be a delegate.
These congresses have no legislative, administrative, or coercive
power over their component parts; their functions are purely
advisory like those of the district conferences of the Congregational
churches in America.</p>

<p>A newly formed group usually gets itself into touch, by correspondence,
with its senior groups somewhat after the manner
of a Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle or the local branch
of a &#8220;correspondence university.&#8221; Thus: &#8220;The group <i>Les Vengeurs</i>
would like to put itself into communication with the existing
groups. Those who have not received a personal letter, but
who wish to correspond, are requested to direct their letters to
the following address,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Union meetings of several groups are not infrequent. Thus:
&#8220;<i>L&#8217;Avenir Social</i> of St. Ouen invites the <i>camarades</i> of the groups
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of St. Denis, Stains, Argenteuil, Puteaux, and Aubervilliers to
a grand meeting which will be held Sunday, February 17, at 8.30
o&#8217;clock.&#8221; But these union meetings can no more bind by their
action the individual groups participating than the &#8220;union temperance
meetings&#8221; of the churches of New England towns can
bind the action of the individual churches participating.</p>

<p>Anarchist mass meetings are relatively rare. If landlords are
found willing to let their halls to anarchists,&mdash;and such landlords
are not plentiful,&mdash;the police interpose at the last moment. Besides,
money to pay for a hall is not always forthcoming, and the
hesitancy of even the warmest sympathisers to compromise themselves
by appearing publicly in the company of the <i>camarades</i> has
to be reckoned with. But the anarchist has ways of holding a
mass meeting&mdash;without holding it&mdash;that are worth two of holding
it in the stereotyped fashion, and that speak volumes for his
resourcefulness.</p>

<p>One of his favourite devices is to get himself named in due form
a candidate for the Chamber, which gives him the right to cover
the walls of the government buildings with unstamped posters<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and the free use of the public-school property for meetings.
&#8220;Several <i>camarades</i> are astonished&#8221; (I quote from a number of
<i>Le Libertaire</i>) &#8220;to see Libertad a candidate. Reassure yourselves.
With his customary enthusiastic and communicative
eloquence he exposes in his meetings the imbecility and the infamy
of the parliamentary system. Paraf-Javal seconds him
with his marvellous talent as a logician. Between them they
are doing an excellent and useful work. At the last meeting
an auditor&mdash;to carry out the farce of the campaign rally&mdash;proposed
a resolution which was not voted, but which was gayly read by
Libertad in the midst of general approbation. You will perceive
by this resolution that our <i>camarade</i> is not on the point of
occupying a seat in the <i>Palais-Bourbon</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;The electors assembled in the school building of the Boulevard
de Belleville, after having listened to the bogus candidate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Libertad and the <i>camarade</i> Paraf-Javal, conclude (agreeing thus
at every point with the candidate himself) that voting is too
stupid to be thought of, and that liberty of opinion, like every
other liberty, is not to be asked for, but to be taken, whatever the
obstacles. They are determined to send packing all the genuine
candidates in whom they see only imbeciles or knaves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The anarchist&#8217;s sense of humour, you see, is much more
highly developed than is ordinarily supposed. Nothing tickles
this sense of humour more than to pack the meetings of
his antagonists, the bourgeois politicians, divert these meetings
from their primitive object by virtue of numbers, address, strength
of lung, hardness of fist, or all of these combined, and so carry
on his propaganda at the expense of the very persons it is directed
against.</p>

<p>He effects this peacefully, as a rule, if his numbers are overwhelmingly
superior. In this case it is very much an affair
of bravado and lungs. He simply elects a <i>bureau</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> to his mind&mdash;for
so good an end he is more than willing to stifle his scruples
against parliamentarianism&mdash;and, having installed a number of
the <i>camarades</i> upon the platform, carries on the meeting with
his own orators and as nearly in his own fashion as circumstances
permit; of course, not without more or less noise and abusive
protest, if the adherents of the original cause remain in the
audience.</p>

<p>If, however, the numbers are more evenly matched, the interlopers,
without attempting to capture the organisation of the
meeting, make a dash for the front at a preconcerted signal, scale
the platform as though it were a rampart, throw down every
member of the <i>bureau</i> into the body of the house, and send the
speaking-desk with its pitcher and glass of <i>eau sucr&eacute;e</i>, the secretary&#8217;s
table, and all the rest of the platform paraphernalia
flying after them. Then, if resistance is offered on the floor of
the hall, a pitched battle ensues, and the possession of the platform
(except as it gives the advantage of position and an admirable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
chance to strut, game-cock fashion) counts for little, in the
utter impossibility of getting heard, even if it is maintained,
which it is not always, there being instances on record of the platform
being taken and retaken, quite as if it were a strategic redoubt,
several times in a single evening. Supposing, however,
that the interlopers follow up the platform victory by another
victory in the body of the hall, and succeed in ejecting the rightful
occupants completely; the dispossessed, if they are not able
to call up re-enforcements for a re-entry and renewal of the conflict,
have no other redress than to persuade the proprietor of the
hall to vacate it by cutting off the gas supply or by summoning
the police. Either way, they gain nothing but the emptiest sort
of dog-in-the-manger vengeance, since they cannot hope to resume
their own interrupted meeting.</p>

<p>During the days succeeding the Dreyfus affair, when excitement
was running high over the struggle between the nationalists
and the socialists for the control of the Paris municipal council,
a great nationalist mass meeting (&#8221;<i>une grande r&eacute;union patriotique</i>&#8221;),
to be presided over by a nationalist deputy and addressed
by other celebrities of the party, was announced for
half-past eight of a certain Friday evening, in the assembly
room of the Tivoli-Vauxhall, close by the Place de la R&eacute;publique.
On the morning of the night set for the meeting all the nationalist
organs printed the following item:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We are informed at the last moment that the anarchists are
coming in force to-night to our patriotic meeting at Tivoli-Vauxhall
in order to prevent its being held and to transform it into a
demonstration of <i>sans-patrie.</i> They propose to wave the red and
the black flag. We are obliged, therefore, much to our regret,
to take measures to prevent the entrance of our adversaries, and
must limit the entries strictly to those who are provided with invitations.
Invitations may be had by applying at,&#8221; etc., etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the revolutionary organs of the same morning
printed the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>Comit&eacute; d&#8217;Action R&eacute;volutionnaire</i> invites all republicans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
all socialists, and all <i>libertaires</i> [<i>libertaire</i> is a euphonious name
for anarchist] to assist at the public meeting organised by the
nationalists for this evening, Friday, at 8.30, Tivoli-Vauxhall,
rue de la Douane in the Ch&acirc;teau d&#8217;Eau Quarter. All the <i>camarades</i>
and <i>citoyens</i> are urged to wear the red eglantine.&#8221;</p>

<p>To one familiar with Parisian ways these antithetic notices
promised a beautiful scrimmage. There <i>was</i> a beautiful scrimmage.</p>

<p>The doors opened at eight, and during half an hour or more
the persons duly provided with invitations straggled into the hall;
while, on the sidewalk opposite, a hostile crowd of socialists and
anarchists, which the police had the greatest difficulty in restraining,
asserted angrily their right to enter.</p>

<p>Just as the president of the evening, a phenomenally fat politician,
arose to speak, the police lines gave way under the strain
put upon them; there was a terrific stampede across the street,
and before the public had time to pull themselves together again
and before the ticket-takers could oppose the slightest resistance
or really knew what was happening, more than two thousand
persons without invitations had invaded the hall.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Vive la Sociale!</i> <i>Vive l&#8217;Anarchie!</i> <i>A bas l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>&#8221; bellowed

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Vive le Drapeau!</i> <i>Vive Rochefort!</i> <i>Vive l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>&#8221; screamed
the invaded.</p>

<p>And, presto! pandemonium reigned.</p>

<p>In vain the elephantine president brandished his bell and
pounded on the table. In vain he made a speaking trumpet
with his hands and roared through it for order. The antagonistic
yells mounted, collided, cracked, and exploded in mid air.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>A bas la Calotte!</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>Vive l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Vive l&#8217;Internationale!</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>Vive le Drapeau!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the rear of the hall, to the air of <i>Les Lampions</i>, a surging
band chanted,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Enlevez l&#8217;homme tonneau!</i>&#8221; (Away with the hogshead-man!)
a shrill and mocking voice in one corner piped.</p>

<p class="center padr5">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Enlevez l&#8217;homme tonneau!!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>a hundred, five hundred, a thousand voices caught up the derisive
cry.</p>

<p class="center f11 padr4">&#8220;ENLEVEZ L&#8217;HOMME TONNEAU!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>the whole two thousand interlopers bawled.</p>

<p>And, bawling thus, they seethed on to the platform like a wave,
lifted the frantically gesticulating &#8220;<i>homme-tonneau</i>&#8221; and his two
hundred of avoirdupois clean off his feet, and, receding with
multitudinous laughter, swept him down the aisle and out through
the door as if he were a chip, and all his satellites and followers
in the wake of him.</p>

<p>The new broom of the proverb never swept one-half so clean.
Not a nationalist, at least not a nationalist who dared to raise
a nationalist cry, was left in the hall. The socialists and anarchists
were in complete possession; but the real scrimmage of the
evening was yet to come.</p>

<p>A <i>bureau</i> was chosen in which the two parties were about equally
represented, and a resolution was passed branding the nationalists
as tools of the bourgeois and as royalist reactionaries more
dangerous than the royalists themselves. Then a socialist, in an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
excess of zeal, made the blunder of introducing a resolution committing
the meeting to the support of a certain socialist candidate
for the municipal council. The anarchists, holding to their
cardinal principle of non-participation in elections, vigorously
dissented. Hot words followed; the crucial differences between
the doctrines were evoked and emphasised; old injuries were
recalled; old disputes were raked up; old sores were probed and
laid open. Plainly, the hall was much too small for both.</p>

<p>From furious debate the meeting went to still more furious
shouts and counter-shouts. <i>Vive l&#8217;Anarchie</i>, which had so lately
locked arms with <i>Vive la Sociale</i>, now confronted it and hissed
threatenings and curses in its teeth. And from shouts (there
being no &#8220;<i>homme-tonneau</i>&#8221; to kindle saving laughter) the meeting
went to blows. Fists, canes, umbrellas, chairs, and benches
cleaved the air; shoes battered shins and heads concaved stomachs;
clothes were torn, hats crushed in and trampled under
foot; furniture was dismembered, and mirrors, windows, and gas
globes were shattered. The field days of the French Chamber
were left far in the rear, so was even the legendary South Boston
Democratic caucus. The pushing, pulling, pounding, kicking,
scratching, biting, and butting, the oaths and calls for help,
the howls, growls, and yelps of baffled rage and pain, would need
the pen of a French Fielding to describe and transcribe.</p>

<p>Finally, the socialists passed out by the same door as the nationalists,
and in very much the same fashion. But the anarchists
had barely time to catch their breath and to pronounce the socialists
&#8220;the tools of the bourgeois and the most dangerous of reactionaries,
because the most disguised,&#8221; when the police arrived,
and with their fateful &#8220;<i>Messieurs, la r&eacute;union est dissoute</i>,&#8221; backed
up by the extinction of the gas, evacuated the hall.</p>

<p>Once in the street, the anarchists were <i>solidaire</i> again with the
socialists against their common bourgeois enemies, the nationalists.
What is more, all three were <i>solidaire</i> against their common enemy,
the police; and the latter were forced to call on their reserves and
a body of the <i>Garde R&eacute;publicaine</i> to disperse the rioters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>The joint debates (<i>assembl&eacute;es contradictoires</i>) which are held,
now and then, during the political campaigns, are very apt to
degenerate into similar scrimmages. As a rule, such encounters&mdash;there
must be a special providence for scrimmages as there is for

lovers&mdash;work no great
harm beyond bruises to
those engaged in them;
but fatal results are not
unknown. Not long
ago, at an anti-militarist
meeting in the
hall of the &#8220;<i>Mille
Colonnes</i>,&#8221; a man who
had the bad taste or the
misplaced courage to
cry, &#8220;<i>Vive l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>&#8221;
was quickly mauled
to death by
the infuriate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
audience. This was not an &#8220;<i>assembl&eacute;e contradictoire</i>,&#8221; it is true;
but, if it had been, the outcome would probably have been the
same.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say, however, that the anarchists, on such
occasions, are not more intolerant than others. There is no
certainty that a man would have fared better who, alone, in a
patriotic assembly at that time had raised the cry, &#8220;<i>A bas
l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The anarchist, with all his haughty insistence on directness
and sincerity, is not totally averse to taking or administering
the sugar-coated pill. He has <i>punchs-conf&eacute;rences</i> (punch-talks)
and <i>soupes-conf&eacute;rences</i> (soup-talks), the former for himself, the
latter for others. At the <i>punch-conf&eacute;rence</i> he washes down the
word with the beverage of his choice,&mdash;more often wine, coffee,
or beer than the punch which gives the name. At the <i>soupe-conf&eacute;rence</i>
he dispenses to hungry vagabonds the soup that sustains
life and the doctrines that, to his mind, explain it and make it
worth while; precisely as the city missionaries and the &#8220;Salvation
lassies&#8221; dispense food and gospel to &#8220;hoboes&#8221; at the &#8220;mission
breakfasts&#8221; and &#8220;hallelujah lunches&#8221; of English and American
cities and large towns.</p>

<p>In the summer he has &#8220;<i>ballades de propagande</i>,&#8221;&mdash;picnic trips
into the country, which are given a serious turn by doctrinal
speeches, in the open air, after lunch.</p>

<p>He has also&mdash;at least he had for a season&mdash;his weekly <i>d&eacute;jeuners
v&eacute;g&eacute;tariens</i>, at which the somewhat attenuated coating of
sugar which a vegetarian lunch gives to the lecture pill is overlaid
with the more substantial sweetness of frolic, song, and badinage.</p>

<p>He has his theatre (that is to say, he has his amateur theatricals)
about which a glamour of mystery and adventure is shed by the
fact the greater part of the r&eacute;pertoire is under the ban of the
censorship. Entrance to the performances is by invitation only
and free. It is thus the law is evaded, a fixed and obligatory
cloak-room charge replacing the fee of admission.</p>

<p>The <i>Maison du Peuple</i> of the rue Ramey, which calls itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
socialistic from motives of prudence, has a permanent band
of actors (<i>le Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Social</i>) on the border line between professionals
and amateurs, who give evening and matin&eacute;e performances
nearly every Sunday throughout the winter and spring,
and who occasionally go upon the road.</p>

<p>A single announcement will suffice to explain the operations of
this and all similar troupes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">

<span class="smcap">&#8220;Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Social.</span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Before its departure for Belgium, where it is going to give a
series of representations of its great success, <i>L&#8217;Exemple</i>, the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Social</i> has decided to give two other representations (evening
and matin&eacute;e) of the piece of Ch&eacute;ri-Vinet, at the <i>Maison du
Peuple</i>, in order to accommodate the <i>camarades</i> of the suburban
districts.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We invite you, then, <i>camarades</i>, to assist at the third and fourth
representations (<i>strictly private</i>) of <i>L&#8217;Exemple</i>, interdicted by
the Censorship, the unpublished revolutionary drama in 4 acts
and 5 tableaux, which will be given Sunday, the 31st of March, at
two o&#8217;clock and at half-past eight sharp.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;Exemple</i> will be preceded by <i>En Famille</i>, a piece by M&eacute;t&eacute;nier
in one act.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Obligatory cloak-room fee, ten sous.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Invitations may be procured at the <i>Maison du Peuple</i>, 47
rue Ramey, at the offices of <i>L&#8217;Aurore</i>, <i>La Petite R&eacute;publique</i>, and

<p class="tb">As at the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre d&#8217;Application</i> (formerly <i>la Bodini&egrave;re</i>), the
various independent theatres, and the &#8220;Thursdays&#8221; of the <i>Od&eacute;on</i>,
the performance of the revolutionary troupe is usually preceded by
an explanatory or relevant talk either by its author or some well-known
thinker or litt&eacute;rateur. Thus, when Charles Malato&#8217;s

was performed at the <i>Maison du Peuple</i>, Malato himself
provided an introductory lecture, entitled &#8220;<i>Le Cl&eacute;ricalisme
et le Nationalisme.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Above all, the anarchist has his <i>soir&eacute;e familiale</i>. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The anarchist group, <i>Les R&eacute;solus</i>, announce for <i>Mardi Gras</i>

in striking contrast with the reckless <i>abandon</i> of such resorts as

<p>In connection with the <i>soir&eacute;e familiale</i>, it is highly diverting
to note the same advertising dodges on the part of the managers;
the same meaningless compliments to performers on the part of
those who introduce them; the same ill-concealed impatience on
the part of the audience during the serious part of the exercises
for the dancing to begin; the same fluttering preoccupation with
ribbons, robes, coiffures, and aigrettes, and the same jealousies
of superior beauty, superior style, and more numerous or assiduous
adorers on the part of the young women; and the same
fussy solicitude on the part of doting mammas to have their
daughters dance with the young men that are &#8220;likely&#8221; as in assemblies
that do not occupy themselves with lofty ideas and
ideals; also the same tiptoeing excitement over the drawing of
the <i>tombola</i> as in the <i>soir&eacute;es</i> of the working people, who do not
profess a contempt for gain.</p>

<p>But he would be a precipitate reasoner, not to say a sorry churl,
who should pounce on these little charming inconsequences as
refutations of the anarchist theory, or should even call attention
to them as other than reassuring evidence that the anarchist is
a very human and likable being, not unaffected with amiable
vices, and that he is not the abject slave of that angular consistency
which, if it be a virtue at all, is the most unlovely of all the
virtues. Your sound anarchist will probably tell you that he is
sincerely ashamed of these failings, that they are deplorable
relics of the old spirit of over-reaching which cannot, in the nature
of the case, be entirely expelled so long as the old social r&eacute;gime
continues. But this apology is so familiar, so threadbare even,
it has been proffered so many, many times by so many very different
sorts of people, that you prefer to ignore it, and attribute
the anarchist&#8217;s dainty peccadilloes to the good old human nature
which has always made men so much more companionable&mdash;let
us guard ourselves against saying so much better&mdash;than their
creeds.</p>

<p>In all the anarchist assemblies&mdash;the group meetings, the congresses,
the mass meetings, and the various social and semi-social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
evenings&mdash;the <i>trimardeur</i> is a noteworthy figure. The <i>trimardeur</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
(literally, pilgrim of the great road) is a <i>camarade</i> who devotes
himself to winning converts while making his tour of France.
He has a certain kinship with the ancient bard, the medi&aelig;val
troubadour and itinerant friar, and the German apprentice on his
<i>Wanderjahre</i>.</p>

<p>But he is chiefly interesting as being the nearest modern approach
to the early Christian apostle and the most perfect
embodiment of the missionary spirit in existence. Figure him
as the contemporary missionary or missionary agent minus a
salary and a domicile,&mdash;if you can imagine such an anachronistic
phenomenon!</p>

<p>He is usually a skilful and reliable workman who has lost his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
job from his irresistible propensity to spread radical ideas among
his fellow-workmen or for his active connection with a strike.
He sets out on his proselyting tour &#8220;with neither purse nor scrip
nor shoes,&#8221; &#8220;neither bread, neither money&#8221; almost literally; and,
literally, without &#8220;two coats.&#8221; In the country he mingles with
the peasants and farm labourers, sleeping under their roofs, &#8220;eating
and drinking such things as they give,&#8221; and converting as
many as he may, sure of a welcome, for that matter, wherever
there is a lodge&mdash;and where is there not?&mdash;of that most fraternal
of all freemasonries,&mdash;discontent. In the cities he works during
his sojourn, if work is to be had; and, when he &#8220;goes out of a
city,&#8221; he blesses that city if it has &#8220;received&#8221; him, and &#8220;he shakes
off the very dust from his feet as a testimony against it&#8221; if it has
&#8220;received him not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The origin, methods, and manners of the <i>trimardeur</i> have been
well described by one Flor O&#8217;Squarr. I take up his description
at the point where the incipient <i>trimardeur</i> has been turned away
by his employer. &#8220;He offers his labour to the factory opposite,
to the foundry adjacent. Vain proceeding! Unfavourable reports
immediately follow him or have preceded him there. The
employers also combine. He will be received nowhere except
by mistake and for a short time. At the beginning this conspiracy
of the world against him surprises and disturbs him. He
exclaims: &#8216;What have I done to them, then? Why do they drive
me away thus, as they would a mangy or vicious cur? I have
defended my interests and those of my fellows. It was my right,
after all.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Later he discerns injustice in this persistent hostility,&mdash;bourgeois
injustice, <i>parbleu!</i> This discovery provokes in him the
idea of revolt, as a draught of alcohol inflames the blood. Persecution
has begun then. Well, let it be so! He will accept it,
not without pride. The theory of anarchy sinks a little deeper
into his brain, after the manner of a spike on which the employers
have tried their sledges. Then he buckles his belt, turns
up his pantaloons, tightens his shoe-lacing, and gains the <i>trimard</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
with a few sous in his pocket, <i>en route</i> for the nearest large
town, where he hopes to find employment and an unworked field
for his neophytic zeal.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If he sets out from Angers, from Tr&eacute;laz&eacute;, for instance, he
tramps as far as Nantes, where he improvises himself porter or
stevedore along the quays of the Loire, undertaking with the
rashest indifference any occupation for which only muscle is required....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Signalled anew, ... our man rebuckles his belt, turns up again
his pantaloons, retightens his shoe-lacing, and gains the <i>trimard</i>
with a few sous in his pocket, headed towards St. Nazaire or
Brest, towards Rennes or towards Cherbourg, towards any city
whatsoever in which he can hope to earn his bread and convert
men. Along the road he manages to get shelter on the farms,
and he carries on his propaganda among the peasantry.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This tireless fanaticism will carry him through Normandy
towards the regions of the north. He will be expelled from the
spinning-mills of Rouen, the glass-works of Douai, the mines of
Anzin, the forges of Fives. From there he will pass into Belgium,
always &#8216;on the hoof&#8217; (<i>&agrave; pattes</i>) and on the <i>trimard</i>: he will visit
Brussels, where the marvellous workingmen&#8217;s organisations of
Brasseur and Jean Volders will make him shrug his shoulders,&mdash;&#8216;Fudge,
all that! authoritative socialism, that&#8217;; Antwerp, which
will detain him a week, a bit disconcerted by the machine; Li&egrave;ge
and Scraing, which will keep him a month; le Borinage, which he
will contemplate as a promised land. Perhaps he will go into
Germany, the vast Germany so inclement to anarchy,&mdash;that is,
if he does not descend into the east by the Luxembourg, and gain
the Jura by the Vosges.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In two or three years he will have seen many districts and
many countries, and will have scattered behind him everywhere,
indifferently, seeds of revolt without troubling himself about the
nature of the ground. His information will be considerably
augmented. He will have made good by experience the defects
of his education. He will know various languages and <i>patois</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
having spoken Breton at Vannes, Normand at Caen, Walloon at
Namur, Flemish at Gand, Marollien at Brussels, German in the
east or in Switzerland; and, like the cosmopolitan Bohemian
who had learned to borrow five francs in all the tongues of the
world, he will have become capable of preaching anarchy in all
the &#8216;<i>argots</i>.&#8217;...</p>

<p><br /><br /><br />&#8220;If during his travels the <i>trimardeur</i> has not acquired fine
manners, at least he has acquired some very extended notions
on customs and industries. He will know, without referring to
a note, by a simple habit of memory, the distribution of the revolutionary
contingents, here, there, and everywhere, in labour
unions or socialist or anarchist groups, and the efficacy of each;
what can be attempted at Montpellier, what is possible at Calais,
how the iron is extracted at Mont-Canigan, and how it is worked
at St. Chamond; why the fitters of the Seine are better paid than
those of Nevers or Creuzot; where one stands a chance of being
welcomed if one has been driven from the workshops of la Ciotat;
by what artifice one may travel gratuitously in the baggage-cars
of the company of the Midi, etc., etc. This miscellaneous information
is not a bad substitute for science, and forms in fact a
sort of fund of practical science very useful in the every-day life.&#8221;</p>

<p>So runs the first stanza of the <i>Chant des Trimardeurs</i>; and
this <i>chanson</i>, though execrable poetry, is, nevertheless, amply
suggestive of the spirit of the <i>trimardeur</i>, and at the same time
fairly illustrative of the popular revolutionary <i>chanson</i> (<i>chanson
populaire r&eacute;volutionnaire</i>).</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Of all the peoples of Europe,&#8221; said Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
&#8220;the French people is the one whose temperament is the most
inclined to the <i>chanson</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>chanson</i> is the Frenchman&#8217;s &aelig;gis against ennui.... He
uses it sometimes as a kind of consolation for the losses and reverses
he sustains. He sings his defeats, his poverty, and his
ills as readily as his prosperity and his victories. Beating or
beaten, in abundance or in need, happy or unhappy, gay or sad,
he sings always. One would say that the <i>chanson</i> is the natural
expression of all his sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>France&#8217;s <i>chanson populaire</i> has always been one of the most
important breeders and disseminators of social and political discontent.
It has always kept pace with and frequently forerun
revolutions. It is not surprising, therefore, that it is looked on
by the anarchists as one of the most efficacious means of propaganda.
The circulation among the masses of songs of revolt
(<i>chansons de propagande</i>) is vigorously carried on by a number
of revolutionary publishing concerns, which retail them at two
sous each<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and wholesale them at fr. 4.50 a hundred, and
which also distribute them gratuitously as often as a <i>camarade</i>
or sympathiser will provide a fund for the purpose.</p>

<p>In these <i>chansons</i>, logic is deliberately ignored, and metaphysics
and ethics are very little meddled with. All the subtleties
and refinements of the doctrine, all the gentleness and sweet reasonableness
of the accredited expounders of the doctrine, are
crowded out by the necessity for the simple, downright, direct
appeal to the passion which is the <i>chanson&#8217;s</i> peculiar province.</p>

<p>The very titles of these <i>chansons de propagande</i> show that their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
purpose is inflammation rather than persuasion. Notice a few
of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ouvrier, prends la Machine!</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>Crevez-moi la Sacoche</i>&#8221;
(money-bag)! &#8220;<i>Fusille les Voleurs</i>,&#8221; <i>Les Briseurs d&#8217;Images</i>, <i>Le
Drapeau Rouge</i>, <i>Le R&eacute;veil</i>, &#8220;<i>Vivement, Brav&#8217; Ouvrier!</i>&#8221; <i>La
Chanson du Linceul</i>.</p>

<p>When proselytism is not sufficiently pronounced in the <i>chansons</i>
themselves, caustic foot-notes make up the deficiency. Thus
this definition of the word <i>d&eacute;put&eacute;s</i>: &#8220;Deputies are persons who
make rules for others and exceptions for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>These <i>chansons</i>, besides being sung in the various anarchist
functions, appear, along with ballads, amorous ditties, and the
topical songs of the day, on the programmes of the little wine-shop
concerts of the faubourgs, at which each and every person
present is expected to &#8220;do his turn&#8221; and all are counted on to
help out with the choruses. These diminutive faubourg concert
halls are the lineal descendants of the famous historic workingmen&#8217;s
<i>goguettes</i> and <i>guinguettes</i> into which the great D&eacute;jazet was
happy to escape and from which the thought and the spirit of
revolt were never far distant. &#8220;Behind their closed doors,&#8221; says
Jules Claretie, &#8220;the government was roundly berated, the couplets
of the <i>chansonniers</i> there becoming for it more redoubtable than
the fiercest articles of the press.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>chansons de propagande</i>&mdash;the more catchy, least compromising
of them, that is&mdash;are sung in the public squares and on
the street corners of the working districts by the itinerant musicians,
who are at all seasons, but especially at f&ecirc;te times, a picturesque
feature of Paris streets, and who conduct so many
open-air singing schools, as it were, in that they teach their
motley audiences to sing the songs they have the wit to sell
them.</p>

<p>Only a few of the anarchist <i>chansons</i> ever see the types. The
majority either circulate in handwriting among the groups or,
without having been taken down, are transmitted orally, like
the medi&aelig;val folk-songs or the Homeric lays, suffering, like those,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
all sorts of modifications and corruptions of text in the transmission.</p>

<p>Of the <i>chansons populaires r&eacute;volutionnaires</i> which have come
down to the present from the Great Revolution, the <i>Marseillaise</i>,
a true <i>chanson de propagande</i> in its time, well called by Lamartine
&#8220;the fire-water of the Revolution,&#8221; is not in favour with the
orthodox anarchists, because it is essentially patriotic and uses
the offensive word <i>citoyen</i>. The &#8220;<i>&Ccedil;a Ira</i>&#8221; is still sung by the
anarchists, but not always to its original words. The <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i>,
a part of which dates from the Directoire, is sung mainly
by the coal-miners of the region of the Loire. The <i>Carmagnole</i>
alone&mdash;the saucy, rollicking, explosive, diabolic <i>Carmagnole!</i>&mdash;has
held its own against all new-comers, changing, but losing
nothing of its sauciness, its explosiveness, and its diabolism as
it has passed from the versions of 1792-93 through its seven clearly
defined texts to the version of the memorable strike of Montceau-les-Mines
in 1883.</p>

<p>After the execution of Ravachol<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> the airs of the &#8220;<i>&Ccedil;a Ira</i>&#8221; and
the <i>Carmagnole</i> were combined into a chanson called <i>La Ravachole</i>,
which, in spite of this hybrid origin, may fairly be classed as the
latest and by far the most vindictive version of the <i>Carmagnole</i>.</p>

<p>The revolutions of 1830, 1848, and 1871, as well as the Great
Revolution, left to the people generous heritages of bourgeois-baiting
<i>chansons</i>. The barricades of those agitated periods rang
with lyric improvisations born of the ferment and frenzy of the
hour. The authors were oftener clerks or day labourers than they
were poets or professional <i>chansonniers</i>, and their songs, many of
the best of which have survived, were genuine songs of the people.
But the one supremely great <i>chanson populaire r&eacute;volutionnaire</i>
of the last half of the century just closed, a song as striking in its
way as the <i>Carmagnole</i>, the &#8220;<i>&Ccedil;a Ira</i>,&#8221; the <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i>, or the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
<i>Marseillaise</i>, is the <i>Internationale</i>. Wherever there is revolt or
faith in revolt, brotherhood or yearning after brotherhood, this stupendous
hymn of the religion of humanity (for it is much more a
hymn than a <i>chanson</i>) is fervidly and reverently sung. The <i>Internationale</i>
has something of the profundity and awfulness of Martin
Luther&#8217;s &#8220;<i>Ein&#8217; Feste Burg</i>.&#8221; Like that marvellous psalm, it
is at once uplifting and crushing. In concept it is probably the
biggest song of liberty that has ever been written. It is surely
the biggest in this respect of all the French revolutionary <i>chansons</i>.
As the <i>Marseillaise</i>, with its fierce, defiant staccatos and fiery,
resistless appeal, is the perfect lyric expression of the fury of
onset (<i>furia francese</i>) in the field, and as the <i>Carmagnole</i>, with
its madly reeling, rolling, booming rhythms and its terrible,
mocking, blasphemous mirth, is the perfect lyric expression of
the drunkenness and dare-devilness of mobs and barricades,
so the <i>Internationale</i>, with its slow, solemn, stately measure and
its universal reach of feeling and of thought, is the perfect lyric
expression of the eternal might and majesty of humanity. Hearing
it, it is as if one heard the cadenced beat of the million-millioned
tread of the advancing race, sweeping all barriers of pride
and prejudice before it.</p>

<p>In the meetings, the numerous stanzas of the <i>Carmagnole</i> and
the <i>Internationale</i> are generally delivered as a solo from the platform
by a <i>camarade</i> who is blessed with a good memory and exceptional
lung power, the audiences leaping into the choruses.
The effect is invariably inspiriting, whatever the personality
of the soloist or the quality of his voice, and whatever the composition
and the voices of the audience. Indeed, these two <i>chansons</i>
seem to belong to that rare sort of music which cannot be
spoiled by bad, if it be not half-hearted, execution. So that there
is conviction behind it, it carries,&mdash;the music in which sincerity
and fervour atone for all defects of pitch, key, and voice.</p>

<p>In the open air, the more familiar stanzas are sung in unison
just as is the <i>Marseillaise</i>, just as are the songs of the students,
and just as are, for that matter, all the songs of the people in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
France,&mdash;a method by which a great deal more is gained in lilt
and concentration (where only the primal emotions are concerned)
than is lost in charm. And I defy any one who has a
drop of red blood in him to be at the centre of several thousand
excited people who are shouting the <i>Marseillaise</i>, the <i>Internationale</i>,
or the <i>Carmagnole</i>, and not join in, even though his
every instinct and belief be anti-revolutionary and he has neither
voice nor ear. He who has not shared the surging and chanting
of an angry Paris mob has only half experienced the popular
thrill, and can have only half an idea what solidarity of emotion
means.</p>

<p>The <i>Internationale</i> is as much the rallying cry of the opening
of the twentieth century as the <i>Marseillaise</i> was of the opening
of the eighteenth; and it would not be surprising if its author,
Eug&egrave;ne Pottier, who is already called by the faithful &#8220;the Tyrt&aelig;us
of the Social Revolution,&#8221; should win ultimately the same
sort of an apotheosis as Rouget de Lisle won by the <i>Marseillaise</i>.</p>

<p>Poor Pottier, who died in 1887 at seventy-one years of age,
saw only the beginning of the phenomenal vogue of his masterpiece
as a revolutionary slogan.</p>

<p>Pottier was one of the few who dared to speak his mind freely
during the Second Empire, and was a prominent figure on the
barricades of both 1848 and 1871. He was proscribed for
his participation in the Commune, but escaped to America,
where he remained till amnesty was declared. Unable to work
steadily at his trade after his return, because his natural employers
resented the part he had taken in the organisation of his
craft, as well as his share in the Commune, and systematically
neglected as a poet and song-writer by the bourgeois press, his
poverty was terrible at times,&mdash;so terrible that it is no hyperbole
to say that many of his best pieces were written with his heart&#8217;s
blood. They were real cries of real anguish. His boundless love
and pity for the poor and his incessant struggle for the emancipation
of the oppressed turned his life&mdash;like that of the noble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Communard, Blanqui, to whom he dedicated a marvellous sonnet&mdash;into
an uninterrupted series of self-sacrifices; and he stands side
by side with Blanqui among the finest modern revolutionist types.
Many of his <i>chansons</i> besides the <i>Internationale</i> have survived
him. He left also a quantity of far from despicable poems.</p>

<p>They are legion, the men of the people whom anarchy has
inspired of late years to sing; but the majority of them are unknown
to the general public and even to other anarchistic groups
than their own. A few, however, have a Parisian reputation for
their abilities or eccentricities.</p>

<p>Paul Paillette, a quaint, picturesque personality, inhabits a
correspondingly quaint and picturesque lodging, which he calls
his &#8220;<i>grenier de philosophe</i>&#8221; (philosopher&#8217;s garret) on the summit
of Montmartre. He was originally a jeweller; but of late years
he has supported himself by rendering his own productions and
those of Bruant and Xanrof in the salons of the bourgeois, who
gladly pay him for ridiculing and abusing them. He is also a
favourite feature of the union meetings and <i>soir&eacute;es familiales</i> in
several quarters of the city.</p>

<p>Paul Paillette can be bitter, caustic, and violent when he chooses;
but his dominant note is gentle, hopeful, idyllic, and ideal, as the
following <i>chanson</i> from his principal volume, <i>Les Tablettes d&#8217;un
L&eacute;zard</i>, testifies:&mdash;</p>

<p>Brunel, a caf&eacute; gar&ccedil;on by profession, author of <i>Le Chant des
Peinards</i>, has been associated with Paul Paillette in organising
<i>soupes-conf&eacute;rences</i> and <i>d&eacute;jeuners v&eacute;g&eacute;tariens</i>.</p>

<p>Achille Leroy calls himself &#8220;author, publisher, and international
book-seller,&#8221; and his invariable response to the simple salutation,
&#8220;<i>Comment &ccedil;a va?</i>&#8221; (How goes it?) is:&mdash;&#8220;<i>L&#8217;id&eacute;e marche</i>&#8221;
(The idea moves). He earns his living by selling his own
and other iconoclastic works at the doors of revolutionary gatherings,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>&mdash;anarchist
gatherings preferred,&mdash;scrupulously devoting
to the cause whatever he may gain beyond the bare necessities.
Though an honest, harmless body, if ever there was one, he is so
addicted to the spots where trouble is going on or brewing that
he has been arrested many times; for instance, on the day of
the 1899 <i>Grand Prix</i> for having cried, &#8220;<i>A bas les Sergots!</i>&#8221; Achille
wrote a letter of self-defence at that time which was printed in
certain of the newspapers and in the <i>Almanach de la Question Sociale</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
He was also defended in the <i>Journal du Peuple</i> by M.
Lucien Perrin, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Among the condemnations which evoked violent murmurs
from the listeners was that of our worthy <i>camarade</i>, Achille Leroy,
the revolutionary publisher. He had bravely cried, &#8216;<i>Vive la
Libert&eacute;!</i>&#8217; when he was seized by the police and maltreated, as only
these brutes know how. As he was unarmed, and had committed
no violence, the police officers accused him of having cried, &#8216;<i>A
bas les Sergots!</i>&#8217; (what a crime!) The ruse succeeded, and our
friend was condemned to a month of prison without reprieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Auguste Valette, a roving vagabond character, sometimes attached
to a Paris <i>caveau</i> (concert-cellar) or <i>caf&eacute;-concert</i> and sometimes
to a strolling show, gained some little notoriety at the
time of the trial of Salsou for his attempt against the Shah of
Persia, and came near being indicted with Salsou as an accomplice
because two violent anarchist poems by him, dedicated to
Salsou, were found among the latter&#8217;s papers.</p>

<p>Other singers of anarchy are Olivier Sou&ecirc;tre, author of <i>Marianne</i>
and <i>La Crosse en l&#8217;Air</i>, two <i>chansons</i> that enjoy and deserve
high favour; H. Luss, author of <i>La D&eacute;fense du Chiffonnier</i> and
<i>La Gr&egrave;ve de Cholet</i>; F&eacute;lix Pagaud, author of <i>Les Tueurs</i>; Daubr&eacute;,
to whom is attributed the last stanza of <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i>; Hippolyte
Raullot, Jacques Gueux, Martinet de Troyes, Pierre Niton, and
Jean la Pl&egrave;bs, who style themselves &#8220;<i>po&egrave;tes pl&eacute;b&eacute;iens</i>&#8221;; Th&eacute;odore
Jean, Luc, Marquisat, Doublier, etc. It is useless to go on
naming them, as their names mean nothing outside of the revolutionary
circles of Paris.</p>

<p>They are all most striking individualities, however, ranging
all the way from freaks to heroes; and it is the individuality which
they lavish on the rendering of their <i>chansons</i> that constitutes
their drawing power. You must hear a Brunel, a Valette, a Paul
Paillette, sing his own <i>chansons</i> to comprehend the influence they
exert, since, in simple print, the most of these productions seem
decidedly flat.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re La Purge, the jovial-faced cobbler of the narrow, dark,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and tortuous rue de la Parcheminerie in the Latin Quarter, calls
for a special word here, because he perpetuates worthily the
revolutionary tradition of the cobbler.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re La Purge is a perfect modern counterpart of the cobblers
who secreted intended victims of the massacre of St. Bartholomew
under the refuse of their shops; who, under Richelieu, managed
to get letters to prisoners in the Bastille by sewing them between
the soles of the prisoners&#8217; shoes; who were among the first shop-keepers
to set the tricolor cockade over their shops, and made
themselves otherwise remarked for their zeal in the Revolution;
and who, under the Restoration, played an important revolutionary
r&ocirc;le by placarding the walls of their shops with caricatures
and <i>Pasquinades</i> (Pasquino, it should not be forgotten, was a
cobbler) and by secretly circulating seditious pamphlets and
<i>chansons</i>.</p>

<p>The invasion of machinery to do heeling and soling &#8220;while
you wait&#8221; (<i>ressemelage Am&eacute;ricain</i>) is driving out of Paris the old-time
cobblers who made their shops rendezvous of the opposition
and nurseries of revolt. But a few of these cobblers still
persist; and of these P&egrave;re La Purge is the best known, if not the
most talented or most dangerous, example. His <i>Chansons du
Gars</i>, which are issued with a superb cover design by Ibels, display
a great deal of shrewdness and aptness of phrase,&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1898-99 S&eacute;bastien Faure took advantage of the exceptional
chance for agitation offered by the Dreyfus matter to
found an anarcho-Dreyfusard daily, <i>Le Journal du Peuple</i>.
All other attempts to establish a daily anarchist organ seem to have
failed completely,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the <i>Journal du Peuple</i> lived&mdash;if its feeble
panting for existence can rightly be called living&mdash;only a few
months. After its demise, M. Faure, as if to conceal his defeat,
started an anarchist weekly, <i>Les Pl&eacute;b&eacute;iennes</i>, the good will of
which he was not slow and, apparently, not too reluctant to turn
over to another anarchist weekly, <i>Le Libertaire</i> (eight pages, price
two sous a copy), which had been printed intermittently at Montmartre
for a considerable period, and which M. Faure himself
had been instrumental in founding. The public proclamation
of the consummation of the fusion between <i>Les Pl&eacute;b&eacute;iennes</i> and
<i>Le Libertaire</i>, which, being the fusion of two miseries, was at the
farthest possible remove from the up-to-date fusion that goes
to the forming of a trust, is of interest because it throws a great
deal of light on the make-up of an anarchist paper, and on the
anomalous and difficult position in the newspaper world of the
anarchist press:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Because of material difficulties&mdash;want of money, to speak
frankly&mdash;the <i>Libertaire</i> was obliged to suspend publication. It
reappears to-day after a very short eclipse, and we have every
reason to hope that the regularity of its appearance will be exposed
to no fresh interruptions....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We have profited by this short, obligatory vacation to attempt
to group about the <i>Libertaire</i> new forces and more numerous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
signatures; in a word, to take all the measures necessary to insure
it a vigorous life.... You will see elsewhere that our friend S&eacute;bastien
Faure has interrupted the publication of his excellent
<i>Pl&eacute;b&eacute;iennes</i> in order to rally as many readers as possible about
the <i>Libertaire</i>. It is in the <i>Libertaire</i>, then, that S&eacute;bastien Faure
will hereafter express his thoughts as often as he shall feel inclined
to do so.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Furthermore, precious and assiduous collaborators have
formally promised us regular contributions; namely, Laurent
Tailhade, who with his incisive and scholarly pen will treat
especially of the vulgarities of Christianity; Paul Ary Cine, who
will expose barrack life; Rapha&euml;l Dunois, who will chronicle and
interpret the labor movement; Georges Pioch, dramatic and
literary criticism; J. G. Prodhomme, musical criticism; A. R.
Vertpr&eacute;, art criticism; Alfred Griot, review of the reviews; Fred-Pol,
review of the week; Alfred Bloch, scientific <i>chronique</i>; A.
Harrent, anti-clerical <i>chronique</i>....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In a word, we are doing what we can. Let our readers on
their side do what they can in making known the <i>Libertaire</i>,
in seeking new purchasers for it, in sending us financial aid sometimes,
and in establishing in favour of their organ a serious and
persevering propaganda.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In this manner we can be certain that we and ours will have
a journal to voice our opinions, our angers, and our hopes, and
one which we can depend on to lead the people in the way that
is frankly &#8216;<i>libertaire</i>&#8217; on the fast-approaching day when it is
going to be necessary to &#8216;fight it out,&#8217; when all the political parties
are going to fall on each other in order to retain power or usurp
it. We are on the eve of important events. It is the moment
for all of us to show ourselves, to shake off, some of us, our apathy,
others of us our egoism, to silence all our dissensions, to combine
with force will, abnegation, and audacity.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Le Libertaire.</i></p>

<p>Older, solider, more temperate, more dignified, and&mdash;if the
word in such a strange connection is permissible&mdash;more conservative,
indeed so solid, temperate, dignified, and conservative
that it has been more than once referred to as the <i>Temps</i> of the
anarchist press, is <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i>, an eight-page weekly,
sold, like <i>Le Libertaire</i>, at two sous a copy. <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i>
(formerly <i>La R&eacute;volte</i>, and before that <i>Le R&eacute;volt&eacute;</i>), which was
founded at Geneva, Switzerland, by Elis&eacute;e Reclus and Pierre Kropotkine
more than a quarter of a century ago, has appeared regularly
ever since with only slight interruptions and the few changes
of title that commemorate its encounters with the law. It came
to Paris soon after its foundation, being forced to emigrate from
Switzerland on account of the anarchist attempt against the
<i>Palais-F&eacute;d&eacute;ral</i> at Berne. Its most distinguished, and at the same
time most distinctive, feature is a literary supplement made up
in considerable part of selections from the French and foreign
classics and from the writings of contemporary scientists and
litt&eacute;rateurs, not avowed revolutionists, which arraign the evils
of society or support any one of the articles of the anarchist
creed. It also reproduces in full addresses by non-anarchist
celebrities in which concessions are made to revolutionary ideals
or ideas.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;You may seize our journals, our brochures,&#8221; says the editor,
Jean Grave, &#8220;you will not prevent the <i>camarades</i> from reading
what the bourgeois authors have written on the rottenness and
abjectness of the present hour. This alone is more terrible than
all the revendications and threats we can accumulate.&#8221;</p>

<p>From time to time this supplement serves to make public the
addresses prepared for prohibited anarchist congresses, as in the
year of the last Exposition, when it printed the papers which would
have been read at the International Anarchist Congress (euphoniously
named <i>Le Congr&egrave;s Ouvrier R&eacute;volutionnaire Internationale</i>)
if a frightened or over-prudent ministry had not forbidden
the sitting of the congress.</p>

<p>The contents of all the literary supplements thus far issued
have been classified under the heads of War, Militarism, Property,
Family, Religion, Law, Justice, The Magistracy, Poverty, Wage-earning,
etc., and they have been reproduced (with added selections,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
illustrations, and complete bibliographies) in as many
volumes as there are heads.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Thanks, perhaps, to the clever handling of its literary supplement;
thanks, perhaps, to the thoughtfulness and relative tolerance
of the body of the paper, the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i> has an appreciable
circulation among artists, litt&eacute;rateurs, savants, economists,
bibliophiles, and various other sorts of cultured people quite
outside of anarchist circles.</p>

<p>The present editor, Jean Grave, is one of the most winning
personalities in the anarchist or any other contemporary movement
for reform. A <i>Lyonnais</i> by origin, a shoemaker and later
a printer by trade, Jean Grave came to Paris in his early manhood.
He took part in the Commune, and was one of the banished
after its downfall, passing most of his exile in Switzerland,
where he was intimately associated with Kropotkine and
Reclus.</p>

<p>As editor, despite his comparative moderation, he has not been
immune from persecution. Like Kropotkine, his predecessor
in the editorial chair, Jean Grave has a fair experimental knowledge
of the inside of prison walls. A thorough man of the people,
and proud of the fact,&mdash;he has always retained his printer&#8217;s blouse,&mdash;his
person and his writings alike are nevertheless instinct with
the most perfect urbanity.</p>

<p>There is no more picturesque corner in Paris than that on which,
for many years now, the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i> has had its office in
the top of an aged and mellow six-story building whose ground
floor is a wine-shop and whose wrinkled roof and plant-bedecked
dormer-window overlook the sixteenth-century church of St.
M&eacute;dard,&mdash;no more intimate and engaging business interior
than the paper, book, and brochure bestrewn, flower-and-print-decorated,
slanting-walled loft in which Jean Grave (veritable
&#8220;attic philosopher&#8221;) and his assistant make up and administer
their sheet. Nothing could be more open and kind than the welcome
you get when, having felt your way up a winding stair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
as damp and dark as a medi&aelig;val donjon-keep, you turn the latch-key,
hospitably left in the outside of the door, and with a premonitory
knock enter the loft; always providing your entry is
courteous and your coming well motived. Indeed, I know in
all Paris nothing morally finer than the example Jean Grave&#8217;s
gentle, unassuming life offers of consecration to the ideal.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly significant in the fact that the
office of this anarchist organ (whose mission is to be, like the
university settlement, a picket of civilisation carrying light into
dark places) is located on the line where the university and the
industrial districts overlap each other, at the very point where
the <i>Quartier Latin</i> ceases and the Faubourgs Coulebarbe and
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re begin; at the junction of such typical highways as
the rue Claude Bernard, passing the <i>Ecole Normale</i>, the rue
Monge, in which many students lodge, the broad Avenue des
Gobelins, with its evening and Sunday animation as a labourers&#8217;
promenade, and the steeply ascending rue Mouffetard, with its
motley street market for the poor.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The <i>Temps Nouveaux</i>, the <i>Libertaire</i>, and the anarchist weeklies
of the provinces serve to keep the individual <i>camarades</i>, the
&#8220;groups,&#8221; and the <i>trimardeurs</i> in close touch with each other
and with the whole anarchist body, as well as to narrate events,
establish the real significance of the casualty columns of the bourgeois
press, and expound the doctrine of anarchy. They also
lend themselves to mutual relief work,&mdash;raising subscriptions
for the <i>camarades</i> in distress from lack of employment, and securing
comforts for the <i>camarades</i> in prison and for their families.
They likewise signal <i>mouchards</i> (police spies), and predict their
movements, rehabilitate <i>camarades</i> unjustly accused of espionage,
denounce the crookedness of employers, arrange for lectures,
and, especially, utilise for the best interests of the movement
the varied information gleaned here, there, and everywhere by
<i>trimardeurs</i>, who are for them so many unsalaried correspondents.</p>

<p>An anarchist monthly, <i>L&#8217;Education Libertaire</i>, has lately been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
founded by the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que d&#8217;Education Libertaire</i> of the Faubourg
St. Antoine, which is not only the organ of the various <i>Biblioth&egrave;ques
Libertaires</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> of Paris and the provinces, but also a review
of real solidity and distinction.</p>

<p>Its nature and scope may be judged by a brief excerpt from its
first prospectus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;Education Libertaire</i> will contain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I. One or two articles by the writers of note who have accorded
us their literary collaboration. [Follows a list of a score
or more collaborators, of whom Pierre Quillard, A. F. H&eacute;rold,
Urbain Gohier, Charles Malato, Henri Rainaldy, and Laurent
Tailhade have a Parisian or more than Parisian reputation.]</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;II. Certain of the lectures delivered in the <i>Biblioth&egrave;ques
Libertaires</i>. These lectures will also be printed as brochures,
which, the type being already set, will cost nothing but the
paper and printing. We shall get thus the brochure at one sou.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;III. Articles upon the different theories of education and
the attempts at &#8216;<i>libertaire</i>&#8217; education, a large subject, which will
give rise to interesting discussions.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;IV. Communications or articles from the <i>Biblioth&egrave;ques
Libertaires</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;V. A concise summary of the month&#8217;s happenings, social,
economic, foreign, scientific, etc.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;VI. Criticisms of the books of which we shall receive two
copies,&mdash;one for the library of the review, the other to circulate
among the libraries which have given in their adherence to the
review.&#8221;</p>

<p>The number of <i>camarades</i> who are afflicted with the <i>cacoethes
scribendi</i> being almost as great as those who are afflicted with
the <i>cacoethes loquendi</i>, many of the groups have little amateur
papers of their own. These amateur papers sometimes remain
in manuscript, and are read aloud in the meetings (very much
as in the old-fashioned American lyceums); are sometimes mimeographed
for distribution among the members; and sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
are printed, to be sold, by a <i>camarade</i> who has a hand-press at his
disposition,&mdash;rarely by a professional printer. When a group
which is ambitious for a paper does not feel sufficient unto itself
in literary talent, it solicits outside assistance, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The group <i>Les R&eacute;solus</i> is going to print a journal in the form
of a brochure. The &#8216;<i>copains</i>&#8217; call upon the <i>camarades</i> who are
willing to collaborate to communicate with the <i>camarade</i> Rodor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The number of anarchist papers in existence is as nothing to
the number that has disappeared. <i>Le Riflard</i>, <i>L&#8217;Attaque</i>, <i>La
Lutte</i>, <i>Le &#8220;&Ccedil;a Ira,&#8221; Le For&ccedil;at</i>, <i>L&#8217;Insurg&eacute;</i>, <i>Le Droit Social</i>,
<i>L&#8217;Etendard R&eacute;volutionnaire</i>, <i>Le D&eacute;fi</i>, <i>Le Drapeau Noir</i>, <i>L&#8217;Affam&eacute;</i>,
<i>Terre et Libert&eacute;</i>, <i>L&#8217;Audace</i>, <i>L&#8217;Hydre Anarchiste</i>, <i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Ouvri&egrave;re</i>,
<i>L&#8217;Homme Libre</i>, <i>La R&eacute;volution Sociale</i>, <i>L&#8217;Emeute</i>, <i>La Libert&eacute;
Sociale</i>, <i>Le Droit Anarchique</i>, <i>La Mis&egrave;re</i>, <i>Le Deschard</i>, <i>Le Falot</i>,
<i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Libre</i>, <i>Le P&egrave;re Jean Chiffonier de Paris</i>, <i>Le P&egrave;re Peinard</i>,
and scores of others have lived and died in Paris and the provinces
within the last thirty years. Of them all, the most famous, not
because the most violent, but because the most violent with talent
and wit (indeed, the most famous incendiary sheet in France
since the <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i> of Eug&egrave;ne Vermesch), was the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>.
While its circulation was never enormous (8,000-15,000
copies), it came to the knowledge of the bourgeois, and gave
them such a turn that it seems likely to remain in the public consciousness
for at least a generation.</p>

<p>With no display of philosophy (which is not saying it had no
philosophy), it played openly upon the appetites, prejudices,
and rancours of the proletariat. Without reserve or disguise, it
incited to theft, counterfeiting, repudiation of taxes and rents,
killing, and arson. It counselled the immediate assassination
of deputies, senators, judges, priests, and army officers. It
advised unemployed workingmen to take food for themselves
and their families wherever it was to be found, to help themselves
to shoes at the shoe-dealers&#8217; when the spring rains wet their
feet and to overcoats at the clothiers&#8217; when winter winds nipped
them. It urged employed workingmen to put their tyrannical employers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
out of the way, and to appropriate their manufacturing
plants; farm labourers and vintagers to take possession of the farms
and vineyards, and turn the landlords and vine-owners into fertilizing
phosphates; miners to seize the mines and to offer picks
to the stockholders, in case they showed a willingness to work
like their brother men, otherwise to dump them into the disused
shafts; conscripts to emigrate rather than perform their
military service; and soldiers to desert or shoot down their officers.
It glorified poachers and other deliberate breakers of the
law. It recounted the exploits of the olden-time brigands and
outlaws, and exhorted moderns to follow their example.</p>

<p>Citations from the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> are impossible, less because of
a constantly recurring broadness that is more than broadness
(since this might easily be dodged in extracts) than because it
was written in the picturesque slang of the faubourg, which can
no more be rendered into English than <i>Chimmie Fadden</i>, for
instance, could be rendered into French. The very titles of the
articles are untranslatable.</p>

<p>Whatever exception to its morals one may take, one is forced
to admit that the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> was a remarkable production in
its way. For blended drollery and diabolism, <i>camaraderie</i> and
cynicism, <i>gaminerie</i> and gruesomeness, it would be hard in contemporary
writing to find its counterpart. Like the unmatched
narrative of the shipwreck in the second canto of <i>Don Juan</i>, it
was at once rollicking and horrible, flippant and terrible, ribald
and sublime. In it there was no distinguishing between the
antics, grimaces, and piquant impudence of the buffoon and
the imprecations of the tragedian or the anathemas of the prophet;
and, while there were times when the sight of this grinning fury
was merely grotesque, there were others (seconds, at least) when
it was magnificent.</p>

<p>The <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> was even more a one man&#8217;s paper than is
Drumont&#8217;s <i>La Libre Parole</i> or Rochefort&#8217;s <i>L&#8217;Intransigeant</i>. Apart
from the illustrations, which were the work of obscure caricaturists
now thrice famous,&mdash;a fact which gives the file a high value
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
with collectors,&mdash;it was practically all written by its editor, Emile
Pouget. Pouget is by general consent one of the &#8220;best fellows in
the world.&#8221; Nevertheless, he is no dilettante revolutionist. His
grievances against society are very real ones. He was forced out
of his original occupation as a dry-goods clerk because he tried
to organise his fellow-employees; and he was condemned (along
with Louise Michel) on disgracefully insufficient evidence for
a misdemeanour in connection with a meeting of the unemployed,
of which he was not guilty. The following account of the affair
is so fully substantiated by the official record of the trial that it
may be accepted as practically authentic:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The organisers of this meeting of the unemployed simply
had in view to bring together on the Esplanade des Invalides
the greatest number possible of hungry persons. They intended
it to be less a revolt than a demonstration. They had no
thought whatever of marching on the Elys&eacute;e or on the Ministry
of the Interior. They merely wished to say to the <i>bourgeoisie</i>:
&#8216;Look at us. We are 20,000 without means of existence.&#8217; And
the Esplanade des Invalides had been chosen in order that they
might not be accused of impeding circulation. The police, disturbed
at the idea of so large a number of men assembling in one
place, took every precaution to prevent it. They closed the
Esplanade, and forced those who came to the meeting into the
streets adjacent, where disorders naturally arose. Certain individuals,
who really had eaten nothing since the night before,
invaded three bake-shops. The bake-shops were cleaned out in
five minutes as if by enchantment.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Pouget had pillaged nothing, planned nothing, directed nothing.
He was simply overheard to say of these poor devils during
the pillage: &#8216;They take bread because they are hungry. They
are right.&#8217; He repeated it spiritedly in the assize court, and
he was condemned to eight years of prison for &#8216;incitation to pillage.&#8217;
It would have been more precise to condemn him for
<i>approbation</i> of pillage, since, in point of fact, he had not committed
any other crime.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>During its entire existence the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> carried on an extensive
traffic in brochures, <i>chansons</i>, etc., of the same violent
nature as itself. It also published an <i>Almanack</i> for 1894, which
is now rare and much prized in book-collecting quarters.</p>

<p>The first anarchist <i>Almanack</i> was issued in 1892 by S&eacute;bastien
Faure, who made the laughable and, from the point of view of
sale, disastrous blunder of basing it on the anarchist-hated Gregorian
calendar.</p>

<p>Pouget&#8217;s <i>Almanack</i>, forewarned, avoided this rock of offence.
It was a rehash of his paper, supplemented by a lengthy philosophico-historical
disquisition on the calendar, appreciations of
all the months, allegorical observations on tides and eclipses,
an anarchist chronology, and a bundle of fantastic predictions,&mdash;all
in the paper&#8217;s highly coloured <i>faubourien</i> slang.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If ever,&#8221; says Jean Grave somewhere, &#8220;the history of this
movement is written, if ever it is revealed how the anarchist publications
have lived, how they have amassed sou by sou the sums
necessary to their appearance, the world will be astounded at
the proofs of solidarity and devotion which will thus be brought
to light. It will appreciate what a force conviction is, especially
among the most disinherited.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something pathetic as well as diverting about the forced
preoccupation of the anarchist organs with the question of the
money which they consider it a part of their mission to depreciate,
something well-nigh cruel in the ironical destiny that compels
them to be perpetually harping on the thing which it is one of
their pet dreams to abolish,&mdash;to plead on their last pages for
the same thing their first pages abuse.</p>

<p>This inconsequence between the thought and the deed is not,
however, to be confounded with hypocrisy. It is accepted because
unavoidable, but accepted sorrowfully and bitterly; and it
does not profit individuals.</p>

<p>In choosing to depend for their sinews of war on the contributions
of the <i>camarades</i> rather than on the advertising which would
contaminate and enslave them, the anarchist journals have certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
chosen the lesser moral evil. There is even a certain
Quixotic heroism in this choice, which is the more apparent
since it is at the price of this inestimable, if incomplete, moral
independence that the socialists are able to carry on a propaganda
of a wider range. By way of compensation for their sacrifice
in refusing bourgeois advertising, it sometimes happens
that the anarchist journals are supported, without running the
slightest moral danger, by bourgeois funds. So it was that in
the Faubourg St. Antoine several years ago the anarchist cabinet-makers
preached the annihilation of their employers during several
months. The cabinet-makers founded an organ entitled
<i>Le Pot-&agrave;-colle</i> (<i>The Glue-pot</i>), in the first number of which they
chanced to give one of the manufacturers a terrible castigation.
The relatively small edition printed was sold so fast that the
<i>camarades</i> most interested barely managed to get copies. A
watch was set on the news-stands of the faubourg, and it was discovered
that it was the business rivals of the attacked manufacturers
who had snapped up the papers. The discovery was
utilised to such good purpose that the phenomenal popularity
of the <i>Glue-pot</i> continued just as long as there was a manufacturer
left in the district to &#8220;roast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following statement of the review <i>L&#8217;Education Libertaire</i>
to its subscribers gives a better idea than pages of explanation
by an outsider could give of the poverty to which anarchist publications
are subject and of their uphill struggle to get the wherewithal
to live:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center padt1 padb05">&#8220;TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Those of our readers who have followed our attempt month
by month know by what a slow progression we have arrived at
the bringing out of this Review.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We shall continue, as in the past, to publish in each number
the accounts of the preceding number. This will enable the
readers to appreciate the pecuniary effort that must be made if
the publication is to be continued.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We have received a hundred francs for this number and forty
for subsequent numbers. We have lumped the money all together
to pay in part for this number. We shall not appear
again until we have in the treasury the necessary sum. It is for
our readers, if they approve of our attempt, to interest their friends
in the Review, and engage them to subscribe.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We have accepted subscriptions of three months, six months,
and one year. By that we mean subscriptions for three numbers,
six numbers, and twelve numbers. If the state of our treasury
does not permit us to appear every month, our subscribers
will, none the less, receive as many numbers as they have subscribed
for at the rate of ten sous per number. <span class="smcap">We formally bind
ourselves</span>, having received subscriptions for one year, <span class="smcap">to print
the Review twelve times</span>. As to dates, we guarantee nothing.
The <i>camarades</i> who are the administrators of this journal are
workingmen, able to dispense very little money; and it would
take them long months of self-assessment to get together the 200
francs necessary for the publication of each number.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To facilitate the diffusion of our Review and the search for
new subscribers, we have prepared special propagandist numbers,
which we will send, postpaid, for five sous each to readers
who are already subscribers. These special numbers have
printed on every page in red ink, &#8216;<i>Read and Circulate</i>.&#8217; They
may secure subscribers for us if each of us pass one or two
about in his own circle.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As to the next number, we urge the <i>camarades</i> who have subscribed
for only three months or six months to make their subscriptions
annual, in which case we shall be able to appear again
early in December.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">The accounts referred to in the second paragraph of the above
are exceedingly suggestive reading. They recorded one subscription
of twenty francs. The remainder of the subscriptions ranged
from two sous to two francs. The total receipts were fr. 57.10.
The expenses of printing and mailing the number were fr. 73.60,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and the incidental expenses were fr. 11.55. The deficit for this
number was, therefore, fr. 28.05; but, the deficit on the two preceding
numbers having amounted to fr. 32.80, the review at the
end of its third number showed a deficit of fr. 60.85.</p>

<p>Very trifling seems this deficit to those of us who are accustomed
to read the balance sheets of large journals, but very real and very
embarrassing are the difficulties which it presents to the publishers
of an anarchist periodical. The financial statement is
followed by this notice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To cover this deficit and reimburse the <i>camarades</i> who advanced
us money, we offer for sale at ten sous, postpaid, the
one hundred and thirty copies of the Preparatory Series which we
still have left (3 numbers with covers, 18 pages each).&#8221;</p>

<p>The acknowledgment of subscriptions and contributions through
the columns of the papers is theoretically for the sake of saving
the labour and expense of correspondence and postage; and, when
the names of the contributors are given by initials only, as is sometimes
done, the device may stand for what it claims to be. But
when, as too frequently happens, the names are printed in full,
it is impossible not to suspect the editors of catering to precisely
the same sort of vanity as that which lies back of bourgeois subscription
lists.</p>

<p>These account columns are further utilised by the <i>camarades</i>&mdash;but
here at least the taint is scarcely a bourgeois one&mdash;for the
launching of pleasantries (more or less astute) and for the expression
of sentiments, the affirmation of brotherhood, the declaration
of principles, and the utterance of prophecies or threats.</p>

<p>In a recent subscription list of <i>Le Libertaire</i> these signatures appeared:

is the sale of anarchist pictures.
Up to 1886 a portrait of Louise
Michel was the only picture published
under anarchist auspices.
In that year <i>La R&eacute;volte</i> (now <i>Les
Temps Nouveaux</i>), having become
convinced of the proselyting
value of pictures, attempted
to buy for reproduction such of
the plates of the illustrated weekly
<i>L&#8217;Illustration</i> as had or could be
given a revolutionary meaning.
This attempt failing, it set about
producing a series of pictures of
its own called <i>Images de Propagande</i>, to be sold at prices ranging
from ten to twenty-five sous. These <i>Images de Propagande</i> are
all genuine works of art by artists of renown, and the complete
collection is much sought by amateurs. The <i>Temps Nouveaux</i>
has also turned to the advantage of the propaganda the illustrated
postal card fever, and has prepared a series of anarchist
pictures especially for children.</p>

<p>The pictorial propaganda has gained even the provinces. The
following is an excerpt from an anarchist periodical:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>camarades</i> of Roubaix will soon enter into possession of
their little press. For a long while they have ardently desired
a press, but some efforts still remain to be made. If we make
a pecuniary appeal to the <i>camarades</i>, it is that we may get together
more quickly the sum necessary for the purchase.... To hasten
matters, if possible, a <i>Roubaisien camarade</i> has had the idea of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
photographing on a plaque of good size (18 by 24 centimetres)
the engraving representing the Chicago martyrdom and a drawing
with the portraits of Emile Henry,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Caserio,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and Angiolillo
on a plaque of 9 by 12 centimetres. Price, Martyrs of Chicago,
fr. 1.40, postpaid; Henri, Caserio, Angiolillo, 85 centimes, postpaid.
Send orders to,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>There is probably no greater obstacle to the progress of the
written propaganda than the perpetual petty annoyances that
arise from an inadequacy of funds. It is by no means the only
one. The anarchist who has already in hand the means to pay
for having his journal printed is often unable to find a printer
who will undertake the work. &#8220;The <i>copains</i> of Grenoble,&#8221;&mdash;the
item is from a <i>trimardeur&#8217;s</i> report,&mdash;&#8220;after having done
everything in their power to launch their paper, rebuffed by all
the printers (downright refusal, exorbitant charge, etc.), have
decided to buy a mimeograph and to autograph manifests, which
they will sow broadcast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supposing his journal printed, however, the anarchist editor
is still far from the end of his troubles. He has to get it properly
distributed; and in this undertaking, likewise, he encounters
numerous difficulties.</p>

<p>It is so compromising in every way

to be known as a reader of an anarchist
publication that few even of the sympathetically
inclined, unless they have
a pronounced taste for
martyrdom, care to lower
themselves in the eyes of
their postman, their
<i>conci&egrave;rge</i>, and their
neighbours, and to run
the risk of being black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
listed in all quarters by receiving an anarchist paper regularly
through the post. Besides, they have a perfectly natural reluctance
to pay in advance the subscription price of three months, six
months, or a year, for a paper that may not be able to keep
alive two months. They prefer to buy the numbers at the
news-stands as they come out,&mdash;a procedure which not only
considerably diminishes the publisher&#8217;s net returns, but keeps him
in a highly inconvenient uncertainty with regard to his budget.
In some years the news-stand sale of the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i>, for
instance, has been nine-tenths of the whole circulation.</p>

<p>This very news-stand sale is lessened by the indifference or
positive ill-will of the newsdealers, who either decline to handle
anarchist papers at all; or, if they do handle them, contrive to
keep them well out of view. Furthermore, the railway and post-office
authorities take a mischievous or malignant delight in delaying
the delivery of anarchist printed matter when they cannot
find pretexts for holding it up altogether.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We receive frequent complaints, which we know are justified
for the most part,&#8221; says <i>Le Libertaire</i>, &#8220;on account of tardiness
in the arrival of our paper. We assure our dealers and subscribers
that the journal is sent out regularly every Thursday, barring
the weeks when money is lacking. Consequently, it is to the
malice of the railroads and the post-office that the delay must be
ascribed.&#8221;</p>

<p>To counteract these and other hindrances to the sale of their
wares, anarchist editors have to resort to numerous devices.
These devices may be in the form of stereotyped requests to readers
to secure other readers, and to force the hands of the dealers,
of which the following are good examples:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;<i>Friends and Readers</i>,</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If you would be useful to the <i>Journal du Peuple</i>, and serve
the ideas which it defends, buy several copies and distribute
them to the persons whom you judge capable of buying it later for
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We urge our friends in Paris to keep demanding our paper
of the newsdealers in order to compel them to handle it. A bit
of determination on the part of each, and <i>&ccedil;a ira</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Often the advertisement appears as a more presuming and
exacting appeal to loyalty, as, for example:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;Our liquidation of the end of the year permits us to spare a
quantity of back numbers. We beg those of our friends who are
willing to take upon themselves their distribution, either in the
meetings or at the doors of the factories, to let us know how many
copies to send them.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb2">At other times, resort is taken to such original and audacious
schemes as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Journals for All</span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The reactionary press penetrates into the rural districts, while
many of the <i>libertaire</i> journals are unknown there. We remind
our readers that the enterprise &#8216;<span class="smcap">Journals for All</span>,&#8217; 17 rue Cujas,
holds itself at their disposition to give them the addresses of
poor provincials who would be delighted to receive their papers
once they have been read. It will cost them a stamp of two
centimes each day and the trouble of wrapping and addressing.
In thus sending away their papers, our readers will be doing a
work highly advantageous to the propaganda. Write the secretary
for fuller particulars.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quotetb">&#8220;Here is a means of circulating our paper which, employed upon
a certain scale, would be highly efficacious: All the <i>camarades</i>
who can make the sacrifice of a certain number of copies should
roll them into a more or less tempting small package, wrap them
well to protect them, and then throw them into the doorways of
houses, slip them into the baskets of women on their way to or
from market, or give them to the children in the street to take
home to their parents.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p class="tb2">Finally, the wily stratagems of a determined and not over-scrupulous
secret police and the special rigour of a body of more
or less biased judges in applying Draconian laws of exception
must be reckoned with. In no department of their work do the
former display more cunning or the latter more severity. Nevertheless,
they have never been able, combined, to prevail over
the intensity of the anarchist proselyting spirit far enough to prevent
for any length of time the spread of the written word. Trick
has been matched by trick and audacity by audacity. The
defiance with which the authorities are met is well typified by
the following manifesto:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Readers and Subscribers of</span> <i>L&#8217;Insurg&eacute;</i>, <span class="smcap">take notice</span>!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We announce to our readers that we shall not be able to appear
this week; but, in spite of all the rascalities of the government,
we intend to appear in the breach again very soon. <i>Vive
l&#8217;homme libre dans l&#8217;humanit&eacute; libre! Vive l&#8217;Anarchie!</i></p>

&#8220;<span class="smcap padr1">Santaville</span><br />
&#8220;[Managing Editor of <i>L&#8217;Insurg&eacute;</i>].&#8221;
</p>

<p class="tb">Previous to 1881 the press law was such that a condemned
journal was forced to change its name, if it wished to reappear;
and the tradition survives of an anarchist sheet at Lyons
which suffered eighteen successive condemnations (involving
for the managing editors imprisonment for terms varying from
six months to two years), and which, therefore, bore successively
eighteen different names.</p>

<p>After 1881 until the passage of the special anarchist restrictive
acts popularly known as the <i>Lois Sc&eacute;l&eacute;rates</i>, a journal could pass
through any number of condemnations without losing its identity;
the guilt of the responsible editor being held as purely personal.
It was during this golden age of relative liberty that the
<i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> saw ten of its managing editors condemned within
three years&mdash;as a cavalry officer leading a charge may see horses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
shot out from under him&mdash;without having its advance materially
impeded.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Once the condemned editor was out of the way,&#8221; says a writer
familiar with the administration of this curious journal, &#8220;it was
as if no condemnation had intervened. There was somewhere
on the <i>trimard</i> in France or abroad an anarchist who owed to
the state two years of Ste. P&eacute;lagie and a 3,000-franc fine,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but
the journal was not touched. <i>Le P&egrave;re Peinard</i> remained unassailable....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;From the number and the gravity of the sentences imposed
it would seem that the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> must have experienced great
difficulty in the recruitment of its editors or that it must have
paid them enormous salaries. Quite the reverse. The fanaticism
of the anarchists was such that they vied with each other
in imploring of Pouget the favour of a chance to be condemned.
At any given moment several were impatiently awaiting their turn.
Never did the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> pay one of its editors. Never did it
even allow him a free subscription. The editor of the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>
was a special type, a volunteer of the assize court, who went
to the prison as water goes to the river, and who pushed his disinterestedness
to the point of buying his own paper&mdash;two sous
out of his pocket&mdash;every Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the present laws it would be more difficult for so saucy
and reckless a sheet as the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> to keep up its laughter
over the discomfiture of the authorities; that is, if it were printed
in France.</p>

<p>To-day a paper of this sort, to appear here with anything like
an approach to regularity, would have to be printed in some foreign
town that is tolerant towards anarchists, and smuggled through
the mails inside of other journals or in covers with unsuspicious
titles. This propaganda at long range is too expensive to be
carried on in a wholesale fashion. It has its periods of favour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
however, and is never totally neglected. Apropos of unsuspicious
cover titles, it is on record that the journal <i>L&#8217;Internationale</i>,
which used to be printed in the French colony of London, regaled
the prying eyes of the French post-office employees and the police
with such more than reputable inscriptions as these: <i>Mandement
de S. E. le Cardinal Manning</i>, <i>Petit Trait&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie</i>, <i>Rapport
sur la Question du Tunnel Sous-Marin</i>, <i>Contes Traduits de
Dickens</i>, <i>Lettres d&#8217;un Pasteur sur la Sainte Bible</i>.</p>

<p>Once, at least,&mdash;more than once, it is probable,&mdash;anarchist
doctrines have been preached in a journal founded and supported
by the prefecture of police,&mdash;an ideal arrangement, it would
seem, since both parties thereto find their account therein, the
anarchists in having a chance to say their say without grubbing
for funds, and the police in having large occasion for self-felicitation
over their shrewdness in keeping the anarchists under strict
surveillance.</p>

<p>The practical impossibility of carrying on a journal successfully
without a permanent and known office, subscription lists,
and the assistance of the newsdealers, has made the anarchist
resort to the secret issue by unknown presses of placards and hand-bills
whenever he has anything very special or very incendiary to
say,&mdash;particularly at election time, when he is exceedingly active
in preaching abstention from the polls, and during the enrolment
and departure of the conscripts. The police will tear down the
placards, of course, but rarely before they have been read; and
they may arrest the distributors of the fliers, but this does not
recall the fliers which have been put forth. More than this they
cannot do, since either there is no printer&#8217;s mark to guide them
or, if one appears, it is false or fantastic, such as &#8220;117 <i>rue de la
Libert&eacute;</i>, <i>ville de la Fraternit&eacute;</i>, <i>Etats-Unis de l&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</i>, <i>D&eacute;partement
de l&#8217;Egalit&eacute;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tantalising documents float into the streets quietly and gently
like snowflakes, before the very eyes of the police, and are irresponsible
as snowflakes, having nothing more than these about
them to indicate their itinerary or origin.</p>

<p>Here is an election placard which may serve as a sample:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center padt1">&#8220;A BAS LA CHAMBRE!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;People, retake your liberty, your initiative, and keep them.
The Government is the valet of Capital. Down with the Government!
Down with the king, Loubet! To the sewer with
the Senate! To the river with the Chamber! To the dunghill
with all this ancient social rottenness! Away with the
Chamber! Away with the Senate! Away with the Presidency!
Away with Capital!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Vive la R&eacute;volution Sociale! Vive l&#8217;Anarchie!</i></p>

<p class="name">&#8220;(Signed)  <span class="smcap">An Anarchist Group.</span>&#8221;
</p>

<p class="tb">In the view of the larger-minded anarchists&mdash;the Reclus,
the Kropotkines, the Graves&mdash;the betterment of society must
be preceded by the betterment of the individuals that make up
society. Education is the corner-stone of the structure their
hope has builded. They realise that they have undertaken a
moral and intellectual labour of long reach, calling for infinite
energy and patience, for years and perhaps generations of scattered,
seemingly bootless initiative, exhortation, and example.
So far as these leaders are concerned, no charge could well be
falser than the one that is daily being brought against them of
ignoring the calendar in all their calculations, juggling with an
abstract social man,&mdash;very much as the elder economists juggled
with their &#8220;economic man,&#8221;&mdash;and expecting with childlike
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> to make human nature and the world over in a twinkling.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;For the establishment of the anarchist society,&#8221; says Jean
Grave, &#8220;it is necessary that each individual taken separately
be able to govern himself, that he knows how to make his autonomy
respected while respecting the autonomy of others, and that he
succeeds in liberating his volition from the tyranny of surrounding
influences....</p>

<p class="quote">... &#8220;Now for individuals to dispense with authority, for each
one to be able to exercise his autonomy without coming into conflict
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
with his fellows, it is essential that we all acquire a mentality
appropriate to this state of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thoughtful anarchist is well aware that, for the production
of this appropriate mentality, his placards, posters, and hand-bills,
his pictures and <i>chansons</i>, his weeklies, monthlies, and annuals,
are ludicrously inadequate and inapt. He is far from despising
these agencies. He recognises their value as popularisers
and as ferment; but he is struggling towards a propaganda of
a deeper, more compelling nature as rapidly as he is able. He
would (like the devout Catholic) assume complete control of the
mental training of his children, taking them out of the public
schools, which impose respect for his two bugbears&mdash;authority
and property&mdash;along with other bourgeois commonplaces and
superstitions, in order to give, in schools of his own, the complete,
well-rounded education which he calls <i>l&#8217;&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i>.</p>

<p>M. Paul Robin, who made a passably successful experiment with
this <i>&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i> at the Pr&eacute;vost Orphanage, Cempuis,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
during the years 1880 to 1894, has expounded the meaning of the
phrase in an article which it would be a real pleasure to quote
entire. A few paragraphs will suffice, however, to reveal the
loftiness, the sweetness, and the eminent sanity of his ideas:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The word <i>int&eacute;grale</i>, applied to education, includes the three
epithets, physical, intellectual, and moral, and indicates further
the continuous relations between these three divisions.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i> is not the forced accumulation of an
infinite number of notions upon all things: it is the culture, the
harmonious development, of all the faculties of the human being,&mdash;health,
vigour, beauty, intelligence, goodness....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;&eacute;ducation physique</i> embraces muscular and cerebral development.
It satisfies the need of exercise of all our organs, passive
as well as active,&mdash;a need given the authority of law by physiology.
To note this development and to learn to direct it with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>prudence, anthropometric observations should be made and anthropometric
statistics continuously kept.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The exercise of the senses, the calculations necessary in
sports and in physical exertion of every sort,&mdash;races, workshop
labour, etc.,&mdash;have their influence on the intellect, and render
attractive certain tasks often considered repulsive because of the
awkward manner in which they have been approached.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;&eacute;ducation intellectuelle</i> has to do with two totally distinct
matters,&mdash;matters of opinion, variable, debatable, the cause of
quarrels, antagonisms, rivalries; and matters of fact, of observation,
of experience, whose solutions are identical for all beings.
The old teaching occupied itself almost entirely with the first
matters to the neglect of the second. The new teaching, on the
contrary, should diminish as much as possible the number and
prominence of the first in favour of the second. In whatever of the
first is of necessity retained, notably the acquisition of languages,
it should limit itself to the purely practical side, and reserve the
study of the complicated, illogical evolution of language for a small,
selected group of adults who are well grounded in the sciences....</p>

<p class="quote">... &#8220;On the other hand, the study of nature, of industry (by
its practice in workshops), of the sciences (in laboratories and
observatories), gives to the brain a harmonious development,
makes it well balanced, and imparts a great justness of judgment.
Theoretical study in books should only come after the excitation
given by real practice, to supplement and co-ordinate the elements
which the practice has furnished. From this concordance in the
knowledge and appreciation of real facts results inevitably a tendency
to concord upon all other matters; that is to say, veritable
social peace....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It should not be forgotten that the <i>&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i>, <i>physique</i>,
and <i>intellectuelle</i>, must combine knowledge and art, the knowing
and the doing.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A genuine <i>int&eacute;gral</i> is at once theorician and practician. He
unites the two qualities systematically separated by the official
routine, which maintains, on the one side, primary and professional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
instruction, and, on the other, secondary and higher instruction.
His is the brain that directs and the hand that executes.
He is at one and the same time artisan and savant.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;There is no need of detailing at length a programme of moral
education. Morality, like reason, is a resultant: it depends on
the ensemble. The part of teaching in it is slight. The child
assimilates in the measure of his intellectual development ideas
of social reciprocity and of goodness; but moral education is
especially a work of influence, the consequence of a normal existence
in a normal environment. The physiological r&eacute;gime and the
general direction given to the thoughts by the teaching as a whole
are its principal elements.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Great care should be taken to exclude false, demoralising
ideas, narrowing prejudices, dismaying impressions, everything
that can throw the imagination out of the true into trouble and
disorder, morbid suggestions and excitation to vanity; to suppress
occasions of rivalry and jealousy; to assure the continual view
of calm, ordered, and natural things; to organise a simple, occupied,
animated, varied life, divided between play and work. The
progressive usage of liberty and of responsibility should be developed,
preaching should be done mainly by example, and, above
all, an effort should be put forth to make happiness prevail....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As to the inferior, backward, degenerate children,&mdash;sad consequences
of a succession of hereditary blights, aggravated by
deplorable, haphazard births and a heels-over-head education,&mdash;these
are moral invalids, for whom it is necessary to care with
compassion and of whom almost nothing should be demanded.
It is necessary, doubtless, to take, with all possible humanity,
precautions to prevent their injuring or contaminating the others;
but one must guard one&#8217;s self well against believing that he has
the right to punish them because of a nature for which they are not
responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apart from this one notable experiment, little or nothing has
as yet been done in Paris or elsewhere in France towards the
systematic application of <i>l&#8217;&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i>.
The anarchist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
school, rather pretentiously called a college (<i>le Coll&egrave;ge Libertaire</i>),
opened in 1901 on the edge of the university quarter of Paris,
has only succeeded so far in establishing a few evening courses
for adults, the lack of funds that handicaps every anarchistic
enterprise being supplemented in this case by the difficulty of
securing proper teachers, because of the danger, amounting almost
to a certainty, of loss of position, if regularly employed teachers
lend themselves to a revolutionary enterprise. The recent foundation
by the anarchists of a child&#8217;s paper, <i>Jean-Pierre</i>, is an interesting
experiment along this educational line.</p>

<p>While waiting for the <i>&eacute;ducation int&eacute;grale</i> to win its way, the
more intellectual anarchists are making a strong effort to increase
the study of the masters and of the forerunners and disciples of
the masters. To this end the principal anarchist organs, especially
the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i>, keep on sale and persistently recommend
the reading of the works of the principal dead and living
authors, native and foreign, who have expounded anarchy or who
tend&mdash;or are claimed to tend&mdash;towards anarchy: Proudhon, Stirner,
and Bakounine; Darwin, B&uuml;chner, Herzen, Godwin, and Herbert
Spencer; Ibsen, Bj&ouml;rnson, Tolstoy, Leopardi, and Nietzsche;
Louise Michel, Elis&eacute;e Reclus, Jean Grave, and Kropotkine;
the anti-militarists Richet, Dubois-Dessaule, Vallier, and Urbain
Gohier; the sociologists Charles-Albert and Jules Huret; the philosophers
Guy and Letourneau; Lef&egrave;vre, the student of comparative
religions; Guyau, the moralist; the novelists and dramatists
Marsolleau, Darien, Descaves, Ch&egrave;ze, Raganasse, Lami, Lumet,
and Ajalbert; the Italian Malato, the German Eltzbacher, the
Hollander Nieuwenhuis, the American Tucker, and the Spaniard
Tarrida del Marmol.</p>

<p>Furthermore, selected portions from nearly all these writers
and from Hamon, Saurin, Malatesta, Tcherkesoff, Janvion,
Chaughi, Darnaud, S&eacute;bastien Faure, Lavroff, Paul Delasalle, and
Cafiero, are published, as brochures in editions running as high
as sixty thousand and at prices ranging from one sou to fifteen
sous (usually two sous) each, so that for a total outlay of two or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
three francs those who have not the means to buy or the application
to read the fr. 3.50 volumes may familiarise themselves
with anarchist thought in all its most important bearings. The
real nature of the contents of some of the brochures is disguised
by the use of innocuous titles. Thus a certain appeal to desertion
from the army bears on its cover this inscription: &#8220;<i>Pour la
D&eacute;fense des Int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts Typographiques</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unlike the placards, posters, and hand-bills, most of the brochures
are restrained in tone. Now and then, however, an anonymous
brochure is issued from nobody knows what printing establishment
that startles the public and puts the policy on its mettle.
The most famous of these (worth its weight in gold now to bibliophiles
for its rarity) is the <i>Indicateur Anarchiste: Manuel du
Parfait Dynamiteur</i> (40 pages, published 1887).</p>

<p>The <i>Indicateur Anarchiste</i> was practically a reprint of a series
of articles that had appeared in the London journal, <i>L&#8217;Internationale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
under the rubric &#8220;<i>Un Cours de Chimie Pratique</i>,&#8221; which
articles were in their turn practically a reprint of a series that
appeared in <i>La Lutte</i> of Lyons under the rubric &#8220;<i>Produits Anti-Bourgeois</i>.&#8221;
They included minute directions for the fabrication
and use of several explosives and of Greek fire, the common and
scientific names and the prices of their ingredients, and a detailed
description of the tools and vessels best adapted to the various
necessary processes. The announcement of the original series
in <i>La Lutte</i> was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center padt1">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Produits Anti-Bourgeois</span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Under this heading we shall put before our friends the inflammable
and explosive materials which are the best known, the
easiest to handle and prepare,&mdash;in a word, the most useful. These
preparations are not classical. If we point them out to the <i>camarades</i>
notwithstanding, it is because we have discovered that they
are superior to others and offer less danger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We shall mention only the most indispensable products, and
yet these are unknown to many of the <i>camarades</i>. In the approaching
conflict each one must be a bit of a chemist. This is why
it is high time to take matters into our own hands, and demonstrate
to the bourgeois that what we want we want in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">The excitement aroused by the publication and general circulation
of this ominous brochure proved to be well-nigh gratuitous.
Experience has demonstrated that in France, where the most scholarly
anarchists are little inclined to participate in the <i>propagande
par le fait</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> the majority of dynamiters are forced (like Salvat in
Zola&#8217;s <i>Paris</i>), to steal their explosives. They are not capable of
putting the precepts of this so-called popular manual, rudimentary
as they appear, into practice; the required manipulations, even
when reduced to their simplest terms, being too dangerous and
delicate for any but laboratory trained hands to execute.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HEN that great and original child of nature, Thoreau,
the Hermit of Walden, protested against the collection
of taxes in Concord town, he little suspected, probably,
that he was prefiguring a revolutionary movement which,
before the century was over, was to alarm the sleek and the smug
of the Old World and the New; and yet, whether Thoreau realised
it or not, his attitude was the anarchistic attitude and his act
an act of the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>.</p>

<p>The attitude of the American anti-slavery champion, William
Lloyd Garrison, was also essentially anarchistic.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Garrison,&#8221; says Tolstoy, &#8220;as a man enlightened by Christianity,
starting out with a practical aim,&mdash;the struggle against
slavery,&mdash;understood very soon that the cause of slavery was not
a casual, temporary seizure of several millions of negroes by the
Southerners, but an old and universal anti-Christian recognition
of the right of violence of some people over others. The
means towards the recognition of this right was always the evil,
which people considered possible to outroot or to lessen by rude
force; that is, again by evil. And, realising this, Garrison
pointed out against slavery, not the sufferings of the slaves, not
the cruelty of the slave-owners, not the equal rights of citizens,
but the eternal Christian law of non-resistance. Garrison understood
that which the most forward champions against slavery
failed to understand,&mdash;that the sole irresistible means against
slavery was the denial of the right of one man over the liberty
of another under any circumstances whatever.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The Abolitionists attempted to prove that slavery was illegal,
unprofitable, cruel, degrading, and so forth; but the pro-slavery
champions, in their turn, proved the untimeliness, the danger, and
the harmful consequences which would arise from the abolition of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
slavery. And neither could convince the other. But Garrison,
understanding that the slavery of the negroes was but a private
case of general violence, put forth the general principle with which
it was impossible to disagree,&mdash;that no one, under any pretext,
has the right of ruling; that is, of using force over his equals. Garrison
did not insist so much on the right of slaves to be free as
he denied the right of any man whatever, or of any company of
men, to compel another man to do anything by force. For the
battle with slavery he put forth the principle of the battle with
all the evil of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The refusal of the citizens of the little French commune of
Counozouls to pay their taxes between 1902 and 1904 because
they were deprived of their hereditary right to supply themselves
with wood from an adjacent forest, and the &#8220;passive resistance&#8221;
of the nonconformists in England to the enforcement of the
new education act, and of the French Catholics to the expulsion
of the monastic orders, are recent instances of probably unconscious
<i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>.</p>

<p>Tolstoy has made a clear and full statement of the purport of the
<i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Taxes,&#8221; he says, &#8220;were never instituted by common consent,
... but are taken by those who have the power of taking them....
A man should not voluntarily pay taxes to governments either
directly or indirectly; nor should he accept money collected by
taxes either as salary or as pension or as a reward; nor should he
make use of governmental institutions supported by taxes, since
they are collected by violence from the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>He holds military service in similar abhorrence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Every honest man ought to understand that the payment of
taxes which are employed to maintain and arm soldiers, and, still
more, serving in the army, are not indifferent acts, but wicked and
shameful acts, since he who commits them not only permits assassination,
but participates in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an apologue, &#8220;Too Dear,&#8221; he demonstrates that law courts,
prisons, and armies are alike useless to a sound civilisation. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
short, Tolstoy renounces the state, and prays for its extinction,
root and branch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The doctrine of humility, pardon, and love, is incompatible
with the state, with its arrogance, its deeds of violence, its executions,
its wars. Real Christianity not only excludes the possibility
of acknowledging the state, but also destroys its foundation....
The sum of all the evil possible to the people, if left to
themselves, could not equal the sum of the evil actually accomplished
by the tyranny of church and state.&#8221;</p>

<p>What could a militant anarchist say more? And there is no
limit to the extent to which these anarchistic utterances of Tolstoy
might be multiplied.</p>

<p>Most French anarchists believe that the privileged will never
surrender their privileges without a desperate resistance. Only
a little handful of them are Tolstoyans in maintaining that simple
non-resistance faithfully adhered to will alone suffice to regenerate
the world. But they nearly all hold that cumulative non-resistance
is, under certain conditions, the most effective resistance
(&#8221;<i>faire le vide autour des institutions sociales est le meilleur moyen
de les d&eacute;molir</i>&#8221;); and a majority of them, probably,&mdash;certainly a
majority of their more intellectual element,&mdash;esteem it by far the
most important propaganda for the present hour.</p>

<p>The average French anarchist is forced to recognise at the outset
the unpalatable truth that a good half of his customary doings
are based on the government and property he opposes. He
rejects the theory of money, but he must buy and sell. He abhors
the state, but serves it, and uses its tax-supported institutions;
and he is constantly finding himself in situations where he must
do violence to his inmost convictions, or get out of life altogether
by the portals of suicide or want. There are some unorthodox
doings, however, which can be avoided without incurring a martyrdom
out of all decent proportion to the seriousness of the occasion.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If the force of power crushes you to-day, if, in spite of everything,
authority fetters you in your evolution, there is always a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
certain margin for resistance. Fill this margin without being
afraid of overstepping it,&#8221; advises one of the moderate advocates
of the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>.</p>

<p>The two forms of non-resistance oftenest enjoined by Tolstoy
(namely, non-payment of taxes and refusal to serve in the army)
are so disastrous in their consequences&mdash;as Tolstoy himself would
have seen, had he not been born into a high estate and had he
not attained a ripe age and an assured position before his revolutionary
ideas completely matured&mdash;that they can hardly be said
to come within this margin. And they are inculcated in France
less with a view to inciting isolated individuals to put them into
practice immediately than in the hope that a day may arrive
when they will be suddenly put into practice simultaneously by so
large a number of persons that coercion will be out of the question.</p>

<p>Similarly, refusal to handle money, to pay interest, to pay rent,
to take oath, to testify in court, and to do jury duty, call down such
speedy retribution that these, too, must be interpreted as lying
in the generality of cases outside the margin mentioned above.</p>

<p>On the other hand, protest against parliamentarianism by abstention
from voting (<i>la propagande abstentionniste</i>) is a thoroughly
feasible kind of non-resistance, and is practised almost universally
by the anarchists of France.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If we seek,&#8221; says Jean Grave, &#8220;to <i>faire le vide</i> around the political
machine, it is to the end of not forfeiting our right to act by
and for ourselves. It is to preserve our liberty of action that we
reject every compromise with the actual political order of things.
It is to habituate ourselves to this liberty which is the <i>summum</i>
of our aspirations that we attempt to exercise it in our struggle
against the present social state. To the individuals whom they
wish to enlist under their banner, the advocates of authority say,
&#8216;Send us to the Chamber to make laws in your favour!&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To those whom they wish to make think, the anarchists, after
having exposed the facts, explain that they have no favours to expect
from anybody; and that, when a thing seems to them bad,
the best way to destroy it is to &#8216;<i>faire le vide</i>&#8217; about it; ... that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
never await from the good pleasure of their masters the authorisation
to conform their acts to their thoughts; and that they
commission nobody to legislate as to what they should do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abstention from marriage (which, as ordinarily practised, the
anarchist considers legalised prostitution, and the theoretical indissolubility
of which he regards as nothing short of blasphemy)
is another thoroughly feasible kind of non-resistance. And it
is rare to find an anarchist, whose marital status was not fixed before
he gave in his adherence to anarchism, who deigns to consult
the pleasure or implore the blessing of any authority whatsoever
in a matter which, to his thinking, concerns no one but
himself and the person of his choice.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Malthusianism, also,&mdash;in spite of a reverence for the procreative
instinct, on the part of anarchists, which Zola&#8217;s <i>F&eacute;condit&eacute;</i>
does not surpass,&mdash;is in high favour in anarchistic circles. The
motives for the anarchist&#8217;s refusal to bring offspring into the world
are set forth in Octave Mirbeau&#8217;s ejaculation of disgust called out
by a project of law for checking depopulation introduced by
one M. Piot into the Senate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I dispute that depopulation is an evil. In a social state like
ours, in a social state which fosters preciously, scientifically, in
special cultures, poverty and its derivative, crime; in a social
state which, in spite of new investigations and in spite of new
philosophies, relies solely on the prehistoric forces,&mdash;murder and
massacre,&mdash;what matters to the people&mdash;the only class, for that
matter, which still produces children&mdash;this much-discussed question
of depopulation? If the people were clairvoyant, logical
with their wretchedness and their servitude, they would desire,
not the cessation of depopulation, but its redoubling. We are
constantly being told that depopulation is the gravest danger
which threatens the future of the country. In what, pray, dear
Monsieur Piot, and you, also, excellent legislators, who lull us ceaselessly
with your twaddle? In this, you say, that there will come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
inevitably a time when we shall no more have enough men to send
out to be killed in the Soudan, in Madagascar, in China, in the
<i>bagnes</i>, and in the barracks. You are dreaming of repeopling
now, then, only for the sake of depeopling later on? Ah, no,
thank you. If we must die, we like better to die at once and by
a death of our own choosing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides discountenancing elections and marriage, the zealous
propagandist <i>par l&#8217;exemple</i> flouts &#8220;those whose sole power lies
in the obedience of cringers&#8221;; defies &#8220;those whose character he
despises&#8221;; refuses to go to law or to accept interest for loans;
abstains from the luxuries which the bourgeois deems indispensable;
protests against insolence on the part of government functionaries,
brutality, high-handed invasion of domiciles, and insults
to women on the part of the police, cruelty on the part of
landlords, and bulldozing on the part of foremen and employers.
He violates deliberately the deep-seated social usages which, equally
with the political, judicial, and economic usages, twist and warp
existence; and strives to keep himself in his labour, his friendships,
and his domestic relations &#8220;saturated with aversion for the bourgeois,
and for whatever in existence savours of capitalism and
the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, and with a sentiment of solidarity towards all who
are struggling for sincere living.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;There is a view [of culture],&#8221; says Matthew Arnold in his
immortal essay <i>Sweetness and Light</i>, &#8220;in which all the love of
our neighbour, the impulses towards action, help, and beneficence,
the desire for removing human error, clearing human
confusion, and diminishing human misery, the noble aspiration
to leave the world better and happier than we found it,&mdash;motives
eminently such as are called social,&mdash;come in as part of the grounds
of culture, and the main and pre-eminent part. Culture is, then,
properly described, not as having its origin in curiosity, but as
having its origin in the love of perfection: it is <i>a study of perfection</i>.
It moves by the force not merely or primarily of the scientific
passion for pure knowledge, but also of the moral and social
passion for doing good.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>Something of the same noble and refined philosophy underlies
this insistence, by the greater anarchist teachers, on the proselyting
value of truth of intercourse and of downright living and
on the consequent necessity of the training and purifying of the
individual as the surest means of changing a social <i>milieu</i>. In
the individual refusal to live the &#8220;conventional lies&#8221; which Max
Nordau (who has long trembled on the verge of anarchism) anathematised
is a real disintegrating force. &#8220;We must begin with
ourselves,&#8221; says Jean Grave, &#8220;in our efforts at transformation.&#8221;
And it is sure that the saintliness of Louise Michel, the fine simplicity
and modesty of Elis&eacute;e Reclus, the voluntary poverty of
the gentle Jean Grave, and the unobtrusive virtues of their obscure
disciples are factors of tremendous importance to the anarchist
movement. Dialectics are powerless before the blameless
living of such real apostles of &#8220;sweetness and light.&#8221; They
may not have the whole truth,&mdash;they would be the last to claim
that they have,&mdash;but there must be some shred of truth in a belief
that is thus witnessed by beautiful character.</p>

<p>In pinning so much of their faith to the gradual modification
of daily habits of thinking and acting, these anarchists reveal themselves
no mean psychologists and no ordinary students of human
nature; and it is regarding this relatively prosaic <i>propagande
par l&#8217;exemple</i> that the choicest anarchist spirits have spoken their
most sagacious and most winning words.</p>

<p>Thus, the late Pierre Lavroff wrote: &#8220;There exists another form
of propaganda accessible to all temperaments, provided the conviction
be sincere; and many times this form, though wanting the
<i>&eacute;clat</i> which accompanies the burning word or the heroic act,
proves to be the most efficacious in the life of every day.</p>

<p class="quote">... &#8220;The conditions of the actual social r&eacute;gime oppose themselves
at every instant to a life in conformity with conviction more
than the juridical conditions retard the extension of advanced
ideas and more than the police surveillance prevents the revolutionary
agitation.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It has often been remarked that the most considerable transformations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in the ideas of society have occurred, not because
the arguments which were advanced against existing forms and
beliefs had acquired more force, but in consequence of an insensible
modification in mental habits. During entire centuries
the same arguments were repeated; but the habits of thought acted
as a cuirass, and repulsed for a long time all the attacks made
against error. Then, at a given moment, this cuirass yielded,
all at once, without any apparent cause. Religious doubt, political
liberalism, the propaganda of socialism, are more or less
prominent examples. The heroic acts which strike the imagination
merely prepare a soil which befits these changes. The
great majority lets itself&mdash;and will a long time yet let itself&mdash;be
guided by habits. Arguments make no great impression upon
it. It modifies its customs by imitation alone. In the case of heroic
acts this imitation extends only to individuals exceptionally
placed. Its veritable domain is the daily living. Every new
doctrine which embraces practical moral elements must provide
a series of models which may be imitated, not by an exceptional
hero, but by an ordinary man. The numerous examples incorporate
the new doctrine into the daily life. They are, broadly speaking,
the most efficacious propagandists of new ideas. Truth
realising itself in living is much more accessible than truth in a
state of thought. The ideas which an individual propagates act
upon a small number, upon the best prepared. A way of life is
less conspicuous, but exercises a more intense action on the masses.
The propaganda carried on by the daily example is the most potent
auxiliary of the spoken word. It surpasses often in influence
the most energetic agitation directed against an existing evil....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;For the majority of men the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i> is the
only form which makes tangible the spoken propaganda. It
alone changes the habits of thinking and living. It produces,
in fact, a modification of the psychic dispositions of society; and
it opens the way for society to be influenced by the energetic acts
of exceptional individuals, for whom it prepares a receptive soil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before words of such keen observation and high moral and philosophic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
import from men who have not forgotten how to think
because they seem sometimes to dream, only an attitude of reverence
is possible; and the admission is forced that some of these
anarchists are not so very flighty, after all, and that some of them
are &#8220;not so bent on acting and instituting, even with the great
aim of diminishing human error and misery ever before their
thoughts, but that they can remember that acting and instituting
are of little use, unless they know how and what they ought
to act and institute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another manifestation of the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i> has
been the creation, in France and abroad, of anarchist experiment
stations where an effort has been made to realise on a small scale,
by isolation from the world at large, the social arrangements
which are, on a large scale, the anarchist dream.</p>

<p>The agricultural colony founded in Algeria by M. Regnier,
one of the sons-in-law of Elis&eacute;e Reclus, seems to have been the
only really successful venture in this line; and I am not sure
whether even this is still in existence.</p>

<p>The other anarchist colonies set up abroad&mdash;notably <i>La Colonie
Cecilia</i>, which was one of the by-products of the emigration
from France to South America&mdash;have all come to more or less
speedy grief.</p>

<p>The reasons are not far to seek. The colonists were totally
ignorant of the regions to which they emigrated. They looked
to find easier living and well-nigh perfect liberty, and were amazed
and disillusionised when they discovered that conditions were not
so very different under these new civilisations from what they were
under the old.</p>

<p>They were ignorant of each other. No selection having been
exercised in forming the groups, the orthodox were overshadowed
by the heterodox and by adventurers who were not anarchists
at all; and many even of the orthodox were too timorous or too
weary to resume, under new skies, the struggle which they fancied,
in quitting Europe, they had left behind forever. Misunderstandings,
disputes, and even spoliation were the natural result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>They were farther handicapped by a lack of preliminary funds
for their installations, by the absence of the appliances of civilisation
to which they were accustomed, and by unfamiliarity
with the agriculture or other work they had to do.</p>

<p>But the primary reason&mdash;the reason which may indeed be
said to include all the other reasons&mdash;for the failure of the French
anarchist colonies in foreign lands is that the transition the colonists
were called upon to make was far too abrupt. As Jean
Grave has pointed out in this connection, &#8220;People cannot pass
thus brusquely from a society where fighting and egoism are
obligatory on every being to a society where the relations between
individuals are those of love, of sympathy, of benevolence,
of solidarity, where you take no heed of the faults of those
who surround you, ignoring the follies of your neighbours while
they ignore yours. The existing social state has in no way prepared
us for solidarity and benevolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The French attempts to found anarchist colonies at home have
fared little, if any, better than the attempts to found them abroad.</p>

<p>A communistic workshop, opened in Paris in 1885 by a number
of anarchistic tailors whom a strike had left without employment,
was closed at the end of a year; but whether by reason
of internal disagreements or by reason of the intrigues of interested
employers it is not easy, from the evidence, to determine.
The product was divided equally among all the members of the
association,&mdash;the unskilled, the sick, the aged, and the impotent
included.</p>

<p>The anarchist <i>Commune de Montreuil</i> (said to be the original of
the <i>phalanst&egrave;re</i> of Descaves&#8217; and Donnay&#8217;s highly successful play,
<i>La Clairi&egrave;re</i>) was established in 1892 at Montreuil-sous-Bois,
a suburb of Paris. A workshop was rented in which the members
spent all the time they could spare from their regular employments
in working for the benefit of those who might be in need,
and Saturday lectures were given. The plans involved, further,
hiring a piece of ground to be cultivated for a similar purpose
in a similar fashion, a gradual cessation of working for employers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
as occasion permitted and results warranted, a school for
children, and a library for adults. These plans were frustrated,
not by the petty rivalries of the women (as in the Descaves-Donnay
play), but by the dissolution of the <i>Commune</i> by the government
as a part of the wholesale anarchist repressions of 1893-94.
Some of the original members of the <i>Commune de Montreuil</i>
have since banded themselves together for an exchange of services
with the idea of habituating themselves to make and utilise products
&#8220;without commercial exchange, representative value, or
appraisal&#8221;; but the exchangers remain in their respective homes.</p>

<p>At Angers, in the Maine-et-Loire, a department remote from
Paris, a number of anarchist workingmen pledged themselves
some time since to divide their wages at the end of each week &#8220;in
order to equalise the conditions of existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is impossible to draw any conclusion whatsoever from experiments
that are so partial as these and that have been conducted
under such unfavourable conditions.</p>

<p>In the two great modern industrial reform movements&mdash;trade-unionism
and co-operation&mdash;the anarchist finds other fields
for the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>.</p>

<p>He is bound to look askance at trade-unions, and, if a purist,
to hold himself aloof from them, because by the very fact of trying
to raise wages they recognise the legitimacy of the wage system,
and because they often resort to politics, and implore the
intervention of parliament to gain their ends.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The unions are wheels in the capitalistic machine because
they are placed&mdash;if only temporarily&mdash;under the conditions of
the capitalistic system,&#8221; says one. &#8220;To accept discussion with
one&#8217;s exploiters is to confess their right to exploitation,&#8221; says
another. &#8220;The <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> of the union is to negotiate with
the employers, to quibble over the greater or less degree of exploitation;
while an anarchist should aim only at the destruction
of this exploitation,&#8221; says still another.</p>

<p>Regarding the efficiency of trade-unions as a means of permanently
bettering the conditions of the working classes, to say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
nothing of insuring their emancipation, the anarchist has no
illusions. On the contrary, he does them scanter justice than
even the capitalist, who, however he may antagonise them, at
least pays them the sincere compliment of fearing them. The
anarchist has not a particle of faith in trade-unionism as such.
He is more orthodox than the most orthodox of economists as
to the iron law of wages (<i>la loi d&#8217;airain des salaires</i>), the inexorableness
of the operation of supply and demand, and the impotence
of strikes. He maintains stoutly that a so-called trade-union
victory can, in the nature of the case, be only the semblance
of a victory, since gains cannot be defended, since an
increase in wages cannot be maintained, against an unfavourable
market, and since, even if it could be maintained, it would be
counterbalanced in the long run by the increased cost of living
consequent thereon. Whoever would oppose the trade-union
theory and practice will find in the anarchist writings and
speeches the completest possible arsenal of weapons ready forged
to his hand. No apologist for things as they are can have
exposed more relentlessly than he the financial foolishness of
fighting millions of dollars with hundreds of dollars, and of pitting
the danger of actual starvation against the relatively insignificant
danger of decreased profits,&mdash;of combating strength with
weakness, in a word, on the former&#8217;s chosen ground.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the anarchist recognises that the trade-union
is a natural grouping of the proletariat; that it was the first important
grouping to acknowledge, by acts, the irrepressible conflict
between capital and labour, the first to boldly lift and wave
the standard of industrial revolt, the first to shift the attempt
at enfranchisement from the political to the economic ground,
and the first to appreciate the advantages of internationalism;
that it is the best considerable example thus far of solidarity in
action, the most favourable soil for anarchistic good seed&mdash;particularly
the good seed of the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>&mdash;within
present reach, the most favourable ground for disputing the future
with the socialists, and an excellent weapon of offence and defence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
And he approves of strikes, with all their demonstrable
financial futility, because they keep to the fore the idea of revolt,
and because&mdash;a sort of left-handed reason&mdash;every unsuccessful
strike is an argument in his favour, inasmuch as it shows the
emptiness of partial measures that do not reach the cause.</p>

<p>Besides, he discerns a trend his way in the growing trade-union
advocacy of the &#8220;universal strike&#8221; (<i>gr&egrave;ve universelle</i> or
<i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>) which he regards as but another name for the
revolution.</p>

<p>At the time of the memorable <i>gr&egrave;ve des terrassiers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Gustave
Geffroy contributed to <i>Le Journal</i> a sketch entitled &#8220;<i>Tableau de
Gr&egrave;ve</i>,&#8221; which is at once a vivid pen-picture and a prophecy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We could easily have believed ourselves, these latter days,
borne backward to the days of the siege of Paris or the weeks
which followed the time of the Commune, in perceiving above
the pedestrians the silhouettes of cavaliers on patrol and the
hands of soldiers in campaign accoutrements in the public squares
and along the banks of the Seine.... When the redoubtable
question of labour and of <i>mis&egrave;re</i> is the order of the day, it is anguish
with silence which reigns in the street where pass the soldiers
under arms.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It has been so everywhere this week. About the stacks of
arms, along the route of the cavaliers, not a cry has escaped, as
if each one, by some tacit understanding, knew that destiny must
not be tempted nor risks run. The public regarded without uttering
a word, gazed fixedly at these sons of the soil and of the
faubourg, wearing uniforms and equipped with provisions and
cartridges as if they were entering on a campaign in this peaceful
city. Where was the enemy? These strikers, slowly promenading,
listlessly dangling their arms,&mdash;they who set forth habitually
to work, and who return from work with a rapid, cadenced
step,&mdash;and quite stupefied at having become idle strollers;
adversaries little fierce, without arms, without their tools even,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
having in their favour only their patience, their passivity, their
hope, and especially their assurance that sooner or later they will
conquer, when all their fellows shall will it like them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is this fatality of the victory of numbers which is the enemy;
it is against this that the regiments and the squadrons have been
sent out, against this that to-morrow they would have trundled
out the artillery. All this parade of force would have been made
this time, could have been made, in fact, only in pure loss....
And so it will be&mdash;we can now affirm it&mdash;on that future day when
the <i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> shall be interpreted in this fashion, when there
shall be everywhere only dismaying calm, the tragic refusal to
work, when the soldiers called out to guarantee order shall find
only order everywhere,&mdash;placid visages and folded arms. Military
display will be useless on that day. The great social change
will have come by the fact of that new sort of revolution which
a reactionary journalist designated very justly, the other day,
by the name of the passive revolution....</p>

<p class="quote">... &#8220;Ah! the good time when the people offered itself freely
as a target on a pile of paving-stones in a narrow street!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This good time is no more. The great boulevards, the broad
avenues, the power of the artillery which can sweep everything
from afar without the insurgents seeing anything but the quick
flame, the sounding light, the cloud of smoke, were already
there to assure the end of the ancient street war. It was not
enough. The revolutionary tactics also have changed, in proportion
as the revolutionary party has extended, has gained in
force, and has become more conscious of its destinies....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Seek not elsewhere than in a profound transformation of the
human mind the cause of the tranquillity of a strike in which
we behold the placid confrontation of the workingman and the
soldier. For all observers endowed with reason and <i>sang-froid</i>,
to whatever party they belong, the spectacle is that of the toiling
mass reconnoitring the ground and testing its strength. Nothing
less than a pacific and irresistible transformation is announced.
Of course, the <i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> can be realised only by an understanding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
throughout an organisation far-seeing and complete,
and then, only, thanks to a certain combination of circumstances;
but this is not saying it cannot be realised.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is easy to brand such a programme as tainted with Utopia
and struck with sterility. But to do so is to refuse to recognise
the sense of facts and especially the power of a unique idea.
Bear in mind that this idea of the <i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> has already thousands
of adherents, not only in France, but in Germany, in England,
in America, and you will have some chance of appreciating
the significance of the strike of to-day, so different from the strike
of yesterday, in spite of a few traditional incidents into which the
strikers and the government have been betrayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geffroy, the writer of the above, is not an anarchist, but a socialist.
Few anarchists see in the <i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>, as he does, a
purely passive revolution, which will prevail without the shedding
of a drop of blood or any other violence whatsoever. Most
of its anarchist advocates regard it, &#8220;not as a strike of folded
arms, but as a general revolt of the proletariat, outside of all
political lines, for the conquest of the means of production and
for complete emancipation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> apart, the anarchist who enters the trade-union<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
does it, incidentally, perhaps, to rid the union of the curse
of politics and to score over the socialists, but primarily to transform
it by the influence of precept (and, still more, of example)
from &#8220;a reform movement for the defence of the material and
moral interests of the workers, and especially the satisfaction
of such immediate desires as the amelioration of salaries and the
diminution of the working day,&#8221; into &#8220;an economic movement
of the working class against the capitalistic class for the suppression
of the latter and of the r&eacute;gime which they represent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consequently, anarchist writings are replete with solemn warnings
to the faithful against the insidious peril of having anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
to do with the unions with any other object in view than that
of making them other than they are.</p>

<p>From co-operation, as from trade-unionism, the purists of
anarchy keep themselves prudently aloof by reason of the risk
of contamination from too close contact with commercial processes
and partial measures.</p>

<p>Other anarchists&mdash;the majority, perhaps&mdash;are still holding
co-operation under observation, waiting for it to display more
satisfactory credentials before they declare themselves. Thus
the <i>Etudiants Socialistes R&eacute;volutionnaires Internationalistes</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> &#8220;have
pronounced for it,&#8221; says A. D. Bancel, &#8220;all in pronouncing
against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others do not object to participating passively in the movement,
so that they are not called on to aid in the work of organisation
and serve on boards and committees.</p>

<p>The rest have espoused it with more or less enthusiasm
because its efforts are economic rather than political, because
it militates against socialism, because it is a phase of the struggle
between classes; because it is of a high educational value to
the proletariat in showing it its real position; because it fosters
internationalism; because its unit, the co-operative group, like
the union, is an expression of solidarity, an excellent field for the
<i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i> and a convenient weapon of combat;
and finally because its ultimate aim is <i>la libert&eacute; int&eacute;grale</i>.</p>

<p>There is a <i>pan-coop&eacute;ration</i> as there is a <i>gr&egrave;ve universelle</i>. And,
as the <i>gr&egrave;ve universelle</i> (which is the revolution) is regarded by
some as the inevitable consummation of trade-unionism, so <i>la
pan-coop&eacute;ration</i>, alias <i>la r&eacute;publique coop&eacute;rative</i>, alias <i>l&#8217;alliance
coop&eacute;rative internationale</i> (which is likewise the revolution), is
regarded by some as the inevitable consummation of co-operation.</p>

<p>By these latter a critical moment is foreseen when the angry
meeting of <i>le capitalisme autoritaire</i> and <i>le coop&eacute;ratisme libertaire</i>
will kindle a colossal, world-wide, and purifying conflagration.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>ITH regard to doctrines, ultimate aims, and the three
methods of disseminating them already described,&mdash;oral
and written propaganda and the propaganda by example,&mdash;French
anarchists are all of the same mind; but with
regard to the fourth means, the propaganda by the overt act
of violence (<i>la propagande par le fait</i>), there is anything but
unanimity among them.</p>

<p>No anarchist, the simon-pure Tolstoyan excepted, denies the
right to collective revolt, the duty, even, of insurrection. But
this attitude has nothing distinctive about it. The same right
and the same duty have been affirmed and reaffirmed by the
republicans of all ages, and by the royalists, also, when they
have been temporarily out of power, the only appreciable difference
being that the republicans and royalists have esteemed
them as a means of realising rather than a means of spreading
their ideal.</p>

<p>The emergence into public prominence of the insurrectional
idea which anarchists had long held&mdash;more or less consciously&mdash;dates
from the Peace Congress held in Geneva in 1867, at
which the Belgian C&eacute;sar de Paepe created a sensation by declaring
that &#8220;not peace, but war, must be preached.&#8221; &#8220;Peace,&#8221;
he explained, &#8220;can be hoped for only as a fruit of victory in the
social war.&#8221; Bakounine, just then coming to the front in
Europe, lent the weight of his authority to De Paepe&#8217;s idea.</p>

<p>In 1876, the <i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Italienne</i> approved a definite declaration
(signed by Cafiero and Malatesta) of the same purport:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Italienne</i> believes that insurrection, destined
to affirm by deeds the principles of liberty, is the most efficacious
agency of propaganda and the only one which, without corrupting
and deceiving the masses, can penetrate even the lowest social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
strata, and draw the live forces of humanity into the struggle
the <i>Internationale</i> is carrying on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Four months later, in the spring of 1877, this credo of insurrection
was put in practice at Letino and San Galo, Italy, where
Cafiero, Malatesta, Ceccarelli, and the rural priests, Fortini and
Tamburini, with thirty followers, took possession of the public
buildings, imprisoned or drove out the local authorities, set fire
to the archives and property records, and seized and distributed
the tax money among the people.</p>

<p>The same year a memorial of the Congress of Fribourg, signed
by Kropotkine and Elis&eacute;e Reclus among others, declared:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We are revolutionists because we desire justice. Never has
great progress, special or general, been made by simple, pacific
evolution. It has always been made by a revolution. If the
work of mental preparation is accomplished slowly, the realisation
of the ideas occurs quickly,&#8221;&mdash;an utterance with which may be
compared Kropotkine&#8217;s, &#8220;Governments have never done anything
but give a legal sanction to accomplished revolutionary facts&#8221;;
Jean Grave&#8217;s, &#8220;We are revolutionists because we have the reasoned
conviction that the privileged will not abandon one of their
privileges if they are not forced to it&#8221;; and this confession of
Guillaume Froment in Zola&#8217;s <i>Paris</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I was only a positivist, a savant given over entirely to observation
and experience, accepting nothing beyond the verified fact.
Scientifically, socially, I admitted a simple and slow evolution,
generating humanity as the human being himself is generated.
And it was then that, in the history of the globe and in that of
societies, I was forced to make a place for the volcano, the abrupt
cataclysm, the sudden eruption, which has marked each geologic
phase, each historic period. One comes thus to perceive that
a step has never been taken, nor a progress made, without the
aid of terrible catastrophes. Every forward march has sacrificed
billions of existences. Our narrow justice revolts, we treat Nature
as an atrocious mother; but, if we do not excuse the volcano, we
must, nevertheless, endure it as forewarned savants when it breaks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
out, and then, ah! then, I am perhaps a dreamer, like the others:
I have my ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The year following the Fribourg Congress (1878) Kropotkine
warmly advocated insurrection before the Congress of the <i>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration
Jurasienne</i>. &#8220;By insurrections,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the anarchists
seek to quicken popular sentiment and initiative to the
double end of a violent expropriation and the disorganisation
of the state.&#8221; The congress pronounced formally in favour
of the insurrectional principle, and from that day to this it
has never been seriously questioned in any important anarchist
quarter.</p>

<p>If the overt act by the individual anarchist is not viewed with
the same unanimous and unqualified approval as the collective
act of insurrection, it is because there is an easy distinction (representing,
perhaps, a real difference) to be made between the
individual act directed against the principle of authority incarnated
in an official of the state,&mdash;president, minister, deputy,
general, senator, judge, and police prefect,&mdash;when it comes under
the general head of regicide (a reform measure which is almost
as old as the world), and the individual act directed against the
principle of property incarnated in any member of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
whatsoever, when it comes under the general head&mdash;O deterrent
power of a name!&mdash;of murder.</p>

<p>The first kind of individual attempt (regicide) encounters little
opposition based on principle within the anarchist ranks. It
is opposed, as Alexander H. Stephens opposed the foundation
of the Confederacy (of which he accepted the vice-presidency,
once it was declared), on grounds of expediency. As regicides,
Caserio, Vaillant,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Bresci,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Pallas (whose attempt against the
Mar&eacute;chal Campos was glorified by the International Labor Congress
at Chicago in 1893), and the assassin of Alexander II.
fall into much the same category as Brutus, Cromwell, Harmodius
and Aristogiton, and the executioners of Louis XVI.; and, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
case at least of the assassin of the czar, the classification, while not
perhaps ideal, might be worse.</p>

<p>As to weapons, the popular distinction (which is, in fact, more
nice than wise) between the pistol and stiletto, on the one hand,
and the bomb, on the other, is not made. &#8220;I admit all means,
even the bomb,&#8221; says Charles Malato, who approved Pallas and
Vaillant, but regretted Henry&#8217;s attempted slaughter of the bourgeois
at the <i>Caf&eacute; Terminus</i>, &#8220;if only it be well placed; and yet
I am not a drinker of blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second kind of individual attempt&mdash;the suppression of
members of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> for the sole reason that they are bourgeois&mdash;is

<span class="captionc">CHARLES MALATO</span></span>

disapproved by all the anarchists
but a small knot of extremists.</p>

<p>This disapproval, which is for the most
part purely formal and passive when the act
attains the person against whom it was directed,
and its unselfishness is immediately
evident, may become aggressive, not to say
bitter, in certain quarters, when a tragic
botch has been made of the job (by a mistake
in victims) or when its significance as
an act of propaganda has been obscured by
the presence of motives of personal revenge.
Elis&eacute;e Reclus, of all the eminent French
theoricians, has shown himself the most consistently
refractory to this sort of <i>propagande
par le fait</i>. In an article called out by the
rapid succession of individual attempts in
1892, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;When you have a grudge against a person,
you seek him out, you have an explanation with him, but you
do not make innocent persons bear the brunt of your rancour.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchy is the <i>summum</i> of humane theories. Whoso calls
himself anarchist should be gentle and good. All overt acts of
the nature of that of yesterday are looked on by true <i>compagnons</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
as crimes. If those who perpetrate these barbarities act with the
design of promulgating the anarchist creed, they deceive themselves
completely.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Things will come to such a pass, there will be such disgust
with the <i>compagnons</i>, they will inspire such horror, that no one
will be willing to hear anarchy so much as spoken of.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And yet the idea is beautiful: it is grand. See to it that it
is respected. The persons who do evil in its name befoul our
doctrines.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not always easy for the outsider to grasp why, of two anarchist
acts of violence with similar exterior aspects, the same
<i>camarade</i> praises the one and deplores the other. What is more,
he will understand still less when the <i>camarade</i> has explained.
There are labyrinths of subtleties in anarchist apologetics through
whose intricate windings the lay intelligence has no Ariadne-given
thread to guide it, and depths of esoteric metaphysics which
only the plummet of the adept can sound.</p>

<p>Vaillant had almost unanimous plaudits from the <i>camarades</i>,
no little praise from the socialists, and approval&mdash;mark the humorous
note!&mdash;from certain of the deputies whose lives he had jeopardised.</p>

<p>Ravachol, author of the explosions at the houses of the judges
Benoit and Bulot and of other overt acts less readily comprehensible,
was practically repudiated at first by the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i>
(then <i>La R&eacute;volte</i>) on account of a dubious past, but was recognised
loyally, if languidly, as soon as his entire disinterestedness was
made plain.</p>

<p>The general attitude of the <i>Temps Nouveaux</i> towards the <i>propagande
par le fait</i> is one of guarded detachment, verging on complete
indifference,&mdash;an attitude of rare prudence, sanity, and sagacity.
It treats the whole matter of the individual attempt as a side
issue, with an unfortunate tendency to divert the attention of both
the faithful and the unfaithful from the basal principles of anarchy,
and makes it very clear that it would ignore it altogether if it
could.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If anarchy,&#8221; says this representative journal, &#8220;does not reject
violence when it is demonstrated to be indispensable to enfranchisement,
it does not elevate it into a system. Violence is for it
a means, debatable, like everything, but which is, at most, only
an accessory affair. It must disappear when the obstacles are
overcome, and weakens in nothing any of the elements of the
ideal itself....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Deeds are not counselled, nor spoken, nor written. They are
done. Sometimes a deed done effects more than a long period
of writing. This journal will always be the first to applaud those
who act. We are, then, far from repelling the <i>propagande par le
fait</i>. Only&mdash;we have said it before, and we repeat it&mdash;the
<i>propagande par le fait</i> cannot be the work of a journal. It is not
for us to say to individuals: &#8216;Do this! Do that!&#8217; If they are
convinced and conscientious, they will know what they have
to do....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To say to the workers, &#8216;Do this, burn that, hang that one,&#8217;
is child&#8217;s play, since the reader may demand with reason why
he who preaches so glibly does not do himself what he urges others
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The American labour leaders are wont to assure us, while reserving
to themselves in all cases the right to criticism and opposition,
that there never has been, using terms broadly, and never
can be, an unsuccessful strike, since the strike that is the least
necessary and most immediately disastrous serves the large purpose
of focussing public attention on the strained relations between
capital and labour, of revealing by a sort of cathode-ray efficacy the
hidden ills of the body politic, and so of bringing just that much
the nearer the final cure.</p>

<p>Similarly, the anarchist leaders assert that in anarchy no forces
are lost, and that the manifestations which are, in appearance,
the most foolhardy and shocking may have, equally with those
which are, in appearance, the most reasonable, the saving merit
of compelling the thoughtless world to think. &#8220;And perhaps,&#8221;
says one of these leaders, &#8220;it will occur to the hide-bound <i>bourgeoisie</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to find society defective when they shall have discovered
that there is some danger in perpetuating its errors.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The anarchist had been told,&#8221; wrote Zo d&#8217;Axa in <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i>,
apropos of the dynamite exploits of an unknown, who turned out
to be Ravachol, &#8220;that the idea for which he was willing to brave
every danger did not exist. He had had it dinned into his ears
that, in other times, the precursors talked less and acted more.
His theory had been laughed at. His hope had been mocked.
When, upon the highway as an apostle, he had attempted to
convert the people, no one of these laughers and mockers had
been willing to tarry and listen an instant.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Now, behold him!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Like the street vender drawing crude charcoal pictures on
the sidewalk to attract the cockney crowd to which he means to
offer an <i>article de Paris</i> a little later, a primitive propagandist
of anarchy has decided to force attention by the brutality of
an act.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Back of this act is the faith, so much tabooed, to which he has
at last drawn fruitful discussion.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It was an Idea the dynamiter displayed.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And no one can deny it,&mdash;at the moment when, by favour of
the excitement, the journals are giving their readers the very
&#8216;<i>articles de Paris</i>&#8217; which the terrible unknown dreamed of showing.
Side by side with their invectives the <i>Figaro</i>, the <i>Eclair</i>,
other sheets, print and expound theories which had not had the
freedom of their columns before. These journals have become,
in spite of their reserves, the propagators of the accursed Idea.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Is it a result?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Men read, discuss, realise perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>To <i>comprehend</i> the foregoing manner of reasoning or, rather,
point of view (the word &#8220;comprehend&#8221; is italicised lest any one
confound inoffensive comprehension with dangerous approval),
one must have had in some country or other some bitter experience&mdash;stinging
rebuke or angering, insulting rebuff&mdash;with the
vapid self-complacency, the dogmatic thick-wittedness, the dictatorial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
stubborness, and the cruel hard-heartedness of the bourgeois.
One must have been shocked and sickened by his vulgar
flaunting of a stupid&mdash;or wicked?&mdash;determination to persist in his
denial that his fellow-men ever starve, unless he can see them, with
his own eyes, throw up their hands dramatically, stagger, and fall
around him.</p>

<p>If one has had this disillusionising experience with the bourgeois,
he will <i>comprehend</i>&mdash;there will be no lapsing here into such
atrociously bad form as hinting the possibility of acquiescence&mdash;that
there are numerous poor devils who say, &#8220;Let the
bourgeois have the dramatic demonstration of starvation, since
he will credit no other!&#8221;</p>

<p>He will <i>comprehend</i> that there are some, not poor devils, who
think that a certain manifestation of the hungry in Trafalgar
Square was a beautiful eye-opener for the British public; that
there are others who look upon the march of Coxey&#8217;s grotesque
army as anything but a ridiculous failure; and that there are
still others who, recalling a memorable famine winter in Boston,&mdash;the
shudderful winter when the authority of the state
was invoked to disperse a peaceable assembling of the unemployed,&mdash;hold
it a real pity that the assembling was quite so
peaceable.</p>

<p>He will <i>comprehend</i> these last when they say that a few broken
window-panes in the swaggering Back Bay and self-sufficient
West End would have made the inhabitants of those districts
less glib in their assertions that there was no real suffering in the
city and less eager, by way of a clinching argument, to parrot,
as having happened to their very selves, the incident which probably
did happen sometime and somewhere to some one, thanks
to some irresponsible tramp&#8217;s sense of humour,&mdash;of the professedly
hungry man who refused to work because he had a previous engagement
to march in the procession of the unemployed.</p>

<p>There is an appreciable distance from broken windows to broken
heads. Still it is plain enough that the person who can <i>comprehend</i>
the point of view that in a given exigency applauds the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
can <i>comprehend</i> (always bear in mind that this word is an innocuous
one) the point of view that in a graver exigency applauds the
second.</p>

<p>If it is true that there are bourgeois, as there are dogs, who understand
no argument and respect no appeal but the blow,&mdash;let
it not be said here that it is true,&mdash;it is not surprising, however
deplorable it may be, that there are those among the proletariat
who find it &#8220;a source of innocent merriment,&#8221; in the words of
Gilbert&#8217;s Lord High Executioner, &#8220;to make the penalty fit the
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anarchist and dynamiter are so far from being interchangeable
terms that it would be possible and, perhaps, justifiable
to write a treatise on the theory of anarchy without making the
slightest reference to dynamiting or any other form of the <i>propagande
par le fait</i>. Taken by itself, the list of the overt anarchist
acts in France during the last twenty-five years seems a long one;
but, when it is viewed in the light of the total number of anarchist
believers, it is evident that the dynamiter is the exception among
the <i>camarades</i>. When, furthermore, the few hundred victims
anarchy has made in all the world during the quarter of a century
it has been militant are compared with the number of the victims
the Minotaur&mdash;poverty&mdash;devours in a single country in a single
year,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> or with the havoc wrought by any one of the commoner
diseases, anarchy as a menace to human life ceases to appear
a very serious matter.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the alarm the <i>propagande par le fait</i> has excited
is not to be wondered at. The dread of the dynamiter, like the
savage&#8217;s dread of the railroad, is a dread of the mysterious and
uncontrollable, superstitious perhaps, but which no amount of
civilisation can entirely eradicate from the human mind. Lightning,
which also does relatively little damage, is feared, and will
probably continue to be feared so long as there is no forecasting
where it will strike.</p>

<p>In the case of the new dynamite propaganda the unknown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
quantities were, in the beginning at least, so numerous as to be
bewildering; and several of them still remain uneliminated. Much
more is now known about anarchist doctrines, about the nature
and power of dynamite, and the other fabulously destructive
modern explosives, and a little more about the characters of the
persons who employ these explosives. But the dynamiter&#8217;s
seeming illogicality in the choice of his victims and his actual
inability&mdash;comparable only to a woman&#8217;s proverbial awkwardness
in throwing a stone&mdash;to attain the victims he has chosen, while
he does attain others, are as pronounced as ever.</p>

<p>When throwers of bombs massacre persons they would not have
harmed for the world, and when bombs are found in such diverse
spots as caf&eacute;s, restaurants, hotels, churches, soldiers&#8217; recruiting
offices and barracks, police stations, bazaars, private dwellings,
public markets, stock exchanges, employment bureaus, and old
people&#8217;s homes, who, indeed, can boast of his security? In the
course of the years 1891-95 the fear of the dynamiters assumed
such proportions as to amount almost to a panic, and this period
is still referred to as &#8220;The Terror&#8221; in certain quarters.</p>

<p>At that time irresponsible rumour attributed to the <i>camarades</i>,
to the &#8220;<i>catastrophards</i>,&#8221; such fell and fantastic schemes for the
annihilation of the old society as the dispersion of malignant
microbes, the poisoning of the water supply, and the introduction
of nitro-glycerine into reservoirs, conduits, and sewers. There
were frequent thefts of dynamite, the authors of which remained
for some time at large. An anarchist <i>cocher</i> (probably demented)
rode down pedestrians in pursuance of a vow he had made to exterminate
the bourgeois. Public alarm was aggravated by the
professional imaginings of the reporters and the police. It was

wantonly played upon by the <i>estampeurs</i> (blackmailers and swindlers
vaguely affiliated with &#8220;the groups&#8221;), who coined money by
selling to a willingly gullible press bogus tips of conspiracies
and contemplated explosions,&mdash;notably the mining of the <i>Op&eacute;ra</i>,
the <i>Palais de Justice</i>, and the Presidential Tribune at Longchamp,
and the assassination of Leo XIII.,&mdash;and by <i>fumistes</i>
(practical jokers), who perpetrated sardonic jokes with sand,

told their heads before venturing to open the street doors
for their own belated lodgers; anarchist tenants were as sedulously
sought as magistrate lodgers were avoided, were loaded
with soft words and favours, and implored not to worry themselves
about their rent bills; and caf&eacute; and restaurant gar&ccedil;ons vied
with each other in flattering the caprices of their anarchist customers.</p>

<p>Flor O&#8217;Squarr tells of an anarchist, real or assumed, who, having
regaled himself with a bountiful repast in a high-priced restaurant
close by the Madeleine, called for the proprietor, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had an excellent meal, and I haven&#8217;t a sou to pay for
it. Arrest me, if you like; but I warn you that I am an anarchist,
and that you expose yourself to the vengeance of my associates.

Choose!&#8221; The panic-stricken Boniface insisted on drinking
the audacious fellow&#8217;s health in champagne, and, when visited
the following day by the police, who had heard of the affair,
refused to make complaint against the swindler or give information
that might lead to his detection. &#8220;A charming person, very
polite, very well bred, and not proud,&#8221; was all that could be got
out of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Le vol</i>&#8221; (theft) is another recognised form of the <i>propagande
par le fait</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you cold,&#8221; says Charles Malato, &#8220;then enter the great bazaars
which are crammed with unused garments, and take them;
are you hungry, invade the meat-shops. Everything human industry
produces belongs to you because you are men, and you are
cravens if you do not take what you need.&#8221; Several international
congresses have passed resolutions exhorting the hungry to take
food wherever they can find it.</p>

<p>About this right of the individual to take for himself whatever
is necessary to sustain his life, a right admitted theoretically,
for the matter of that, by many who do not consider themselves
revolutionists,&mdash;by popes, prelates, and theologians even, all the
way from Saint Thomas to Manning and Parkhurst,&mdash;anarchists
of all complexions agree absolutely. But over the right to steal
in general there is as much dispute among them as there is over
the right to kill. Some hold stealing meritorious, if the victims
are properly chosen; others, if the profits are devoted scrupulously
to the oral or written propaganda; others still, if they are turned
over to the poor. Those who approve theft unreservedly are
few indeed. Jean Grave admits that he is somewhat perplexed,
but inclines to approve the open, defiant theft. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Anarchy recognises in every individual from the moment
he has seen the light of day the right to live. Individuals suffer
from hunger by reason of a defective social organisation. And
yet the planet has still, and will have for a long time, enough
and more than enough to nourish the beings it carries. Every
individual who finds himself reduced by the fault of society to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
a want of bread has the right to rebel against society, to take food
wherever it exists....</p>

<p class="captionc">POSSIBLE REVOLUTIONISTS</p></div>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Nevertheless, there is a thing that puzzles many of us;
namely, the ignoble means it is necessary to employ, if one would
steal, the perpetual deceit to throw the victim off his guard, the
constant duplicity to capture his confidence....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Every one acts as he understands, as he can. If his ways
of proceeding are in contradiction with the established order of
things, it is for him and the defenders of the code to have an explanation.
But, when certain persons pretend to derive their way
of living from a special order of ideas, when they seek to disguise
with the cloak of the <i>propagande</i> deeds done for their own preservation,
we have a right to say what we think.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If, then, we place ourselves at the view-point of the right which
the individual has to live, he may steal. It is his privilege, especially
if society drives him to want by refusing him work. And I add
that it would be very stupid of him to commit suicide when society
has made him destitute. The right to the defence of one&#8217;s own
existence being primordial, one must take where there is.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But, if the act of stealing is to assume a character of revendication
or of protest against the defective organisation of society,
it must be performed openly, without any subterfuge.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;But,&#8217; retort the defenders of <i>le vol</i>, &#8216;the individual who acts
openly will deprive himself thus of the possibility of continuing.
He will lose thereby his liberty, since he will be at once arrested,
tried, and condemned.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Granted. But, if the individual who steals in the name of
the right to revolt resorts to ruse, he does nothing more nor less
than the first thief that comes along who steals to live without
embarrassing himself with theories.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is with stealing as it is with the military service. There
are persons who refuse to let themselves be enrolled, preferring
to expatriate themselves. This way of proceeding has its little
character of protestation. But alongside of these there are others
who, by the simulation of an infirmity, by taking advantage of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
an exemption or the utilisation of an efficacious protection, manage
to evade military servitude. They are right, surely,&mdash;a thousand
times right,&mdash;from their point of view. But, if they tell us
that they have thereby performed acts of revolutionary propaganda,
and contributed to demolish the r&eacute;gime, it would be easy to demonstrate
that their claim is false....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To resort to ruse, to dissimulate, in order to capture the confidence
of the person one is planning to despoil, is, it must be
confessed, an unwholesome and degrading line of conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the few Paris pilferers whose lives have distilled the
odour of sanctity, who have taken on themselves to perpetuate the
tradition of the magnanimous bandit, the philanthropic pirate,
and the tender-hearted outlaw, to incarnate the paradox of the
&#8220;<i>bon voleur</i>&#8221; (honest thief), the two most famous are Pini and
Duval.</p>

<p>Cl&eacute;ment Duval, who robbed and attempted to burn the mansion
of Mlle. Madeleine Lemaire, was an iron worker of an independent
spirit, who became so disgusted with the sufferings and
humiliations of the labourer&#8217;s lot that he determined to make a
dramatic protest. His previous record was absolutely clean, save
for a petty theft from an employer when his <i>compagne</i> and children
had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours; and he carried away
from the Lemaire residence only a small part of the valuables at
his disposal, which shows that gain was not his primary object.
In his written defence, which the presiding judge, Berard des
Glajeux, did not allow him to read, he dwelt at great length on
the hardships of the working-woman. In fact, Duval was a
feminist of the first water. Saint Cl&eacute;ment Duval! Forget him
not, feminists, when you make up your calendar of saints!</p>

<p>In the <i>Revue Bleue</i>, a publication which can hardly be accused
of having a revolutionary bias, M. Paul Mimande wrote of Duval:
&#8220;Well, to my thinking, this thief, this incendiary, is <i>honn&ecirc;te</i>....
I believe him incapable of robbing and killing to satisfy his
cupidity. He worked for the collectivity alone. Duval has the
serenity of the <i>illumin&eacute;</i> who suffers for a holy cause. He is logical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
in submitting, without murmurs or protestations, to the hard rules
of the <i>bagne</i>. Very sincerely, he refuses to find himself disgraced
by the livery of the convict; and he shows it by his bearing and
his talk. His conscience cries out to him that he has acted well.
What does the rest matter!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I had a long conversation with Cl&eacute;ment Duval. I questioned
him searchingly; and I discerned in his phrases, ardent,
but hollow, a sort of atavic duplicate of the times of John Huss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duval had neither instruction nor the gift of eloquence, and
succeeded ill in explaining his theories to the jury of the Seine.
Pini, on the other hand, who had been at great pains to educate
himself, was an orator and philosopher as well as a student. His
defence&mdash;less a defence of himself than of his theory of the right
to steal (<i>le droit au vol</i>)&mdash;was as splendid a bit of impertinence as
was ever delivered in a court-room.</p>

<p>Calmly, cynically, with a control of voice and charm of gesture
that would have done credit to the most gifted advocate, he said
(in part):&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As to us anarchists, it is with the untroubled assurance of
performing a duty that we make our attacks on property. We
have two objects in view: first, to claim for ourselves the natural
right to existence which you bourgeois concede to beasts and
deny to men; second, to provide ourselves with the materials best
suited for destroying your show, and, if it becomes necessary,
you with it. This manner of reasoning makes your hair stand
on end; but what would you have? This is the state of the case.
The new times have come. There was a time when the starving
wretch who appropriated a morsel of bread, and was arraigned
before your plethoric persons therefor, admitted that he had committed
a crime, craved pardon, and promised to perish of hunger
(he and his family) rather than touch again the property of another.
He was ashamed to show his face. To-day it is very different.
Extremes meet; and man, after having sunk so low, is retrieving
himself splendidly. Arraigned before you for having smashed
the strong boxes of your compeers, he does not excuse his act,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
but defends it, proves to you with pride that he has yielded to
the natural need of retaking what had been previously stolen
from him; he proves to you that his act is superior in morality
to all your laws, flouts your mouthings and your authority, and in
the very teeth of your accusations against him tells you that the
real thieves, <i>messieurs les juges!</i> are you and your bourgeois band.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This is precisely my case. Be assured I do not blush under
your charges, and I experience a delicious pleasure in being called
thief by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ma&icirc;tre Labori&#8217;s eloquent pleading, though it did much to establish
his reputation as an advocate, proved as vain in the case
of this refractory <i>prol&eacute;taire</i> as it did later in the case of his bourgeois
client, Dreyfus; and Pini was given twenty years of hard
labour for his thieving and his impertinent impenitence.</p>

<p>Pini whose thefts were legion, Pini who in the guise of the son
of an Italian cardinal paid reconnoitring visits to the archbishopric
of Paris, and dreamed the colossal dream of rifling the
Vatican, Pini, I say, never stole for himself nor for his friends,
but only for the propaganda, for humanity. He was the altruistic
thief of the century&#8217;s close <i>par excellence</i>. Every son of his
thieving was devoted to the cause. He gave to street beggars
freely, but always from his legitimate earnings, never from the
proceeds of his expeditions, and never without reproaching them
for stretching out their hands to beg when they might steal. &#8220;Sometimes,
even in winter,&#8221; says one who claims to have known him
well, &#8220;Pini, half-clothed and almost barefoot, traversed Paris
to carry assistance to the destitute <i>compagnons</i>. He distributed
among them one franc or two francs out of his own pocket; but
he did not encroach upon the capital of two or three hundred louis
which had resulted from his last exploit. He subsidised several
French and Italian presses for the printing of journals, manifests,
and placards. The stolen money belonged to the cause, to the
idea, to the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he gave of his consecrated hoard to individuals, as he
sometimes did, it was always because the propaganda was directly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
involved. Thus he supported for two years at the University of
Milan the son of an imprisoned <i>camarade</i>, and aided many of
the <i>camarades</i> who were in prison or who had been obliged to
flee to escape imprisonment. He was blamed by some of his
associates for having invested a sum of stolen money in an industrial
enterprise. The blame was just from the anarchist point
of view; and yet, even in this case, the profits were plainly destined
in advance for the propaganda.</p>

<p>Within the last two or three years the treasures of the churches
have been the greatest sufferers from the pilferers on principle,
who have been inflamed by the anti-clerical campaign of the
Combes ministry.</p>

<p>As anarchist killings have been very little formidable, viewed
in the large, so the aggregate of the anarchist stealings is, in
social or criminal statistics, a negligible quantity. These stealings
have not brought expropriation appreciably nearer, and have only
served the anarchist cause, if they have served it at all, by keeping
before the public mind the fact that the anarchist theory is as much
opposed to property as it is to government.</p>

<p>The majority of the thieves who call themselves anarchists in
court are thieves first and anarchists afterwards,&mdash;eleventh-hour
converts, who, having fallen on the misfortune of detection, essay
to play anarchist r&ocirc;les, prompted thereto by a sense of humour,
a hope of securing the sympathy and support of the <i>camarades</i>,
or a yearning for the homage of the &#8220;<i>petit peuple de Paris</i>&#8221;, who,
as Marcel Pr&eacute;vost has pointed out, &#8220;adore all revolutionists.&#8221;</p>

<p>One other form of <i>propaganda par le fait</i> remains to be mentioned;
namely, counterfeiting. But anarchist counterfeiting has
not been advocated, it seems, by the accredited anarchist theoricians,
and has not been provided with a romantic halo by any
master practitioner, like Pini; in short, has not attained the dignity
of a public peril, and calls for no extended notice here. The
greater part of the so-called anarchist counterfeiters are common
criminals or vulgar charlatans with whom anarchy is a mercenary
after-thought, or they are simple police spies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>The most picturesque of the real anarchist counterfeiters who
have passed through the judicial mill is the <i>Lyonnais po&egrave;te-chansonnier</i>
known as &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Abruti</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>L&#8217;Abruti</i>&#8221; (&#8220;The Imbruted&#8221;), the uncomplimentary name,
intended as a fling against society, is of his own choosing,
tormented by that craving for the great road, for space and
liberty which has been the blessing and the curse of the
best and the worst of men since time was,&mdash;from Abraham,
Homer, Cain, Esau, and John the Baptist to Morrow, Salsou,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
Ravachol, Richepin, and Josiah Flynt; L&#8217;Abruti swore off
working for the detested bourgeois one fine day, and, shouldering
a little pack in which he had stowed a stew-pan, a coffee-pot, a set
of mysterious steel implements, and some scraps of writing-paper,
set out from Lyons in true troubadour or, to be more accurate, in
true <i>trimardeur</i> style, to make his tour of France.</p>

<p>Sauntering out of the sunrise in the morning, between hedge-rows
traceried with the fragrant eglantine, free of fancy and free
of limb; ruminating the &#8220;<i>heureux temps d&#8217;anarchie</i>&#8221; prophesied
by the <i>po&egrave;te-camarade</i> Laurent Tailhade, &#8220;<i>temps o&ugrave; la pl&egrave;be
baiserait la trace des pas des po&egrave;tes</i>&#8221;; casting about for couplets

<p>exploring the motionless blue and the scudding white of the sky
for a fresh image; exchanging good words and snuff-pinches
with passing rustics and smiles and badinage with the rustics&#8217;
wives and daughters; halting now and again to quaff from a wayside
spring, to catch a thrush&#8217;s liquid note, a magpie&#8217;s gibe, or a
linnet&#8217;s whistle, to unshoulder his pack, and, using it as an <i>escritoire</i>,
to fix on paper a just-discovered rhyme, or, using it as
a pillow, to enjoy the discreet fellowship of a pipe and out of its
curling smoke-fantasies fashion Utopias; beguiling the hours of
the short shadows with alternate scribblings and siestas; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
sauntering into the sunset when the long shadows came,&mdash;L&#8217;Abruti
passed the days.</p>

<p>He dined and supped by the roadside under spicy limes or
voluptuous acacias, lavishing his omelettes, his coffee, and his
<i>chansons</i> on all chance passers-by.</p>

<p>With his mysterious implements and the aid of flame, in some
dusky forest thicket where a witch might weave a spell, he fabricated
the wherewithal to buy his eggs and coffee; and he passed
the nights, according to the weather, under the stars or in some
hospitable grange.</p>

<p>The idyl was rudely interrupted&mdash;a fig for civilisation!&mdash;by
the Philistine-minded gendarmes. L&#8217;Abruti was tried, and condemned
to prison, though he had never gone beyond the fabrication
of the ten-cent piece, instead of being decorated, as certain
bourgeois are who deserve no better of society, and counterfeit
talent instead of dimes.</p>

<p>Served him right, perhaps, for violating his country&#8217;s laws!
Served him right, unquestionably,&mdash;delicious, whimsical minstrel
that he was,&mdash;for departing from the good old begging tradition!</p>

<p>It seems a pity, all the same. He was such a jolly good fellow.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">A</span> study of the various manifestations in France of the
<i>propagande par le fait</i> shows that the greater part of the
overt anarchist acts, whether counterfeitings, stealings, or
killings, have proceeded from a more or less well-grounded desire
for personal or party vengeance; they have been committed by
persons who have either suffered unjustly themselves at the hands
of government or society or have lived very close to those who
have so suffered.</p>

<p>The sensational killing of the assistant superintendent, Watrin,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
by the striking miners of Decazeville (1886) was a horrible crime
or a wholesome act of popular justice, according to the point of
view. The fury of the mob is explained, if not excused, by the
fact that this Watrin was allowed a premium of five per cent. upon
every reduction of wages he was able to accomplish, coupled with
the other fact that his brutal and insatiate rapacity had forced
wages down thirty per cent. in eight years.</p>

<p>The anarchist house-breaker, Cl&eacute;ment Duval, had been seriously
handicapped in the struggle for existence. In the Franco-Prussian
war he had received two wounds which had rendered
him permanently unfit for his trade of iron worker, and had contracted
a disease which had forced him to spend nearly four years
out of ten in various hospitals. He had experienced real want
in the course of his many periods of enforced idleness.</p>

<p>Pini had suffered much at the hands of society and the state.
Many a time, when out of work, he had been glad to sleep on
straw, at two cents a night, in the faubourg of La Glaci&egrave;re. His
autobiography, which he wrote in jail, while awaiting his trial,
is, like every formal utterance Pini ever made, exceedingly illuminating.
Of his early life he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Son of a poor pariah, I began my career surrounded with
the luxuries which the <i>bourgeoisie</i> heaps upon us from our very
cradles. I saw six of my brothers die of want. One of my sisters
wore herself out in the service of a stingy family of bourgeois.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;My old father (an ancient Garibaldian), after a painful existence,
in which he had given to the <i>bourgeoisie</i> sixty years of his
sweat and enriched a good number of employers, died like a dog
in a charity hospital.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I passed my childhood in a charity asylum; and, my primary
studies finished, I was forced at the age of twelve years to go to
work in a printing-office, where I earned just one franc a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Driven from Italy in his young manhood for his connection

in Switzerland, and after a few months came to Paris.</p>

<p>His disillusion in regard to Paris is highly significant. He had
dreamed of finding there democracy, and found flagrant inequality
instead.</p>

<p>He was successively chimney-sweep, bricklayer, groom, coal-heaver,
sawyer, clerk, and street-hawker. His tribute to the
Paris workingmen, with whom he was thus intimately thrown,
is especially fine:&mdash;</p>

had studied the great, practical book of suffering, the pages of
which are printed in characters of blood and tears. It was these
poor pariahs who initiated me into the great anarchistic ideal,
and who, out of the midst of their misery, expounded to me how
society could be tranquil and happy under the r&eacute;gime of essential
justice.</p>

<p>The outrages inflicted by the Clichy police on Dardare, Decamp,

<p class="quote">&#8220;Manacled and bleeding,&#8221; wrote Zo d&#8217;Axa at the time in
<i>L&#8217;Endehors</i>, &#8220;the three men were landed in the station-house.
Their respite was not long. The officers were not slow to pay
the prisoners a visit, and this is what they brought with them:
kicks for shin-bones, pummellings for panting chests, blows of
revolver butts for aching heads. It was the dance of the vanquished.
They mauled the poor fellows with inexorable malice
and ignoble ingenuity. The police band tortured with ferocious
joy.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;When they stopped, it was from weariness and only to reopen
the s&eacute;ance half an hour later. So passed the day of the arrest
and other subsequent days.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Their eyes blackened, their heads swollen and unrecognisable,
their bodies bruised, their spirits broken, the poor fellows had no
more force to resist. They remained inert under poundings as
under the lash of insult. Their wounds festered, and they were
refused water to wash the sores. A month after the arrest the
bullet that might have given him gangrene had not been extracted
from the leg of L&eacute;veill&eacute;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some allowance should be made in the above account for the
evident partisan spirit of Zo d&#8217;Axa. But there is plenty of unbiased
evidence to demonstrate the culpability of the police in this
affair and to explain the epidemic of overt acts that came after it.</p>

<p>Rulliers and Pedduzi, who attempted (the latter with success)
to kill their employers, had both had their work taken away
because of their anarchist belief.</p>

<p>Ravachol had been driven from workshop after workshop for
his opinions. In his defence, which the presiding judge, Darrigrand,
refused to allow him to read, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I worked to live and to make a living for those who belonged
to me. So long as neither I nor mine suffered too much, I remained
what you call honest. Then work failed me, and with this enforced
idleness came hunger. It was then that this great law of nature,
this imperious voice which brooks no retort,&mdash;the instinct of self-preservation,&mdash;pushed
me to commit certain crimes and misdemeanours
for which you reproach me and of which I recognise
myself to be the author.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explosion at the V&eacute;ry restaurant was in retaliation for the
delivery of Ravachol to the police by the gar&ccedil;on L&#8217;H&eacute;rot.</p>

<p>Lorion, who fired on and wounded gendarmes to prove he was
calumniated in being treated by the socialists as a police spy,
had been detained for five years in the House of Correction for
having insulted the police at the <i>age of thirteen</i>.</p>

<p>President Carnot signed his own death warrant in refusing to
commute the sentence of Vaillant, who was condemned to the
guillotine for throwing a bomb which neither killed nor seriously
wounded anybody.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Whether he admits it or not,&#8221; wrote Henri Rochefort, prophetically
at the time, &#8220;M. Carnot will remain the veritable executioner
of Vaillant</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;And, as he will be the only one to benefit by his decision, the
least that can be asked for is that he assume all the risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The exasperation produced by the execution of Vaillant was
aggravated by the indelicacy&mdash;unpardonable from the Parisian
point of view&mdash;of holding the execution during the Carnival,
and by the atrocious pleasantry of the Minister of the Interior,
Raynal, who said, &#8220;<i>J&#8217;ai donn&eacute; des &eacute;trennes aux honn&ecirc;tes gens.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Georges Etievant, who wounded two policemen, had had his
life rendered absolutely impossible by the persecution of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
police. Implicated by them in a theft of dynamite in 1891, he
is said, on good authority, to have served his time rather than
denounce the real culprit, who was a father of a family. Banished
for the first article he wrote after his release, he tried to

practise sculpture in London, but was
prevented by the machinations of the
French secret police, who made him
lose all his work. He was a starving,
shelterless outcast at the moment of
his crime.</p>

<p>Salsou, who attempted the life of the
Persian shah during the Exposition of
1900, had lost work by reason of his
opinions earlier in life. Furthermore,
he had been arrested for vagabondage
at Fontainebleau while making his way
from Lyons to Paris on foot in 1894,
and, this charge of vagabondage being
groundless, had been condemned to
three months of prison for vaunting his
anarchist belief, on the dubious testimony
of a police spy, who had been put into the same cell with
him for the express purpose of &#8220;drawing him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, the condemnation of Salsou to hard labour for life,
in punishment of a relatively insignificant attempt by which no
one was hurt, was based on diplomatic rather than judicial reasoning.
He died soon after his arrival at Cayenne, in consequence,
probably, of the hardships to which he was subjected. His body
was thrown to the sharks in the presence of a number of functionaries,
who amused themselves by taking photographs of the
fight for its possession. Certain of the prisoners, who were witnesses
of this revolting scene, have taken a solemn oath to
avenge it.</p>

<p>It looks very much as if the high-handed suppression of free
speech in France during the early eighties had been largely instrumental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in producing the numerous overt anarchist acts during
the nineties, and as if the continued policy of the authorities
in &#8220;making examples&#8221; by an overstraining of the law had inspired
other anarchists to follow the examples of those who were
made examples of.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The anarchists,&#8221; says Jean Grave, very justly, &#8220;suffer governmental
persecutions, not only when they revolt, which is quite
comprehensible, but even when they content themselves with a
peaceable propagation of their way of understanding things, and
that notwithstanding the fact that at the present time the majority
of the governors pretend to have granted the greatest political
liberty.... The police have been ferocious, pitiless, towards the
workers. They have hunted the anarchists like wild beasts.
For a word a bit strong, for an article a trifle more violent than
usual, years of prison have fallen on them.... Treated like wild
beasts, certain ones act like wild beasts.... &#8216;Who sows the wind
reaps the whirlwind.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1882 sixty-six anarchists were tried at Lyons, and sixty-one
convicted (fifteen for contumacy), among them Kropotkine
and the scientist Emile Gauthier. The unjust condemnation of
Emile Pouget and Louise Michel, referred to in a previous chapter,
came soon after.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Cyvoct was sentenced to death<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> at Lyons,&#8221; says the Chronology
of the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>, under the date December 11, 1883, &#8220;for the
crime of having been managing editor of an anarchist journal at
the moment when an unknown person placed a bomb in a dive
where the swells amused themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>It could not be better put. Cyvoct was in Switzerland at the
time of the explosion, and could not by any possibility have been
the author of it. He was not even the writer of the article which
was held by the court to have provoked the attempt.</p>

<p>The next year Gueslaff was condemned to ten years of hard
labour for an attempt at Montceau-les-Mines, which he made
at the instigation and under the direction of a police agent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Three years later&mdash;to pass rapidly on&mdash;anarchists were sentenced
for revolutionary speeches at Laon. In 1890 Merlino,
Malato, and Louise Michel were incarcerated on the same charge.
There was an indiscriminate and purely preventive ingathering
(<i>rafle</i>) of anarchists the 22d of April, 1892, in prevision of the
trial of Ravachol and the dreaded demonstration of May 1, and
another <i>rafle</i>, also indiscriminate and purely preventive, on the
New Year&#8217;s Day preceding the execution of Vaillant,&mdash;a measure
which wrought untold injury&mdash;could governmental malice or
stupidity go farther?&mdash;to anarchist workingmen, and brought
untold suffering on their families, from the fact that it coincided
with the moment for the payment of the January rent (<i>terme</i>).<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
It was of the former <i>rafle</i>, in which he was included, that the litt&eacute;rateur
Zo d&#8217;Axa, in his piquant <i>De Mazas &agrave; J&eacute;rusalem</i>, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The police drag-net trick of this month of April, &#8216;92, will
become historic.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is the first in date among the most cynical assaults of modern
times upon liberty of thought.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The true inwardness of the affair is now known.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The government wished to profit by the emotion caused by the
explosions of the <i>Caserne Loban</i> and the rue de Clichy to encircle
in a gigantic trial of tendency the militant revolutionists. The
ministry and its docile agents pretended to believe that certain
opinions constituted complicity. The writer, explaining how the
disinherited gravitate inevitably towards theft, became, by the
simple fact of this explanation, a thief himself. The thinker,
studying the wherefore of the <i>propagande par le fait</i>, became the
secret associate of the lighters of tragic fuses. The philosopher
had no right to counsel indulgence and to view without giddiness
the facts.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Society must rid itself of those of its members who are so
corrupt as to desire it better....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Evidently, the impartiality of the judges was not to be counted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
on. The word of command had been passed along. It would
be useless to prove that not only we were not cut-purses nor cut-throats,
but that no organisation existed among us, even from
the political point of view. The tribunals would sentence us
with the same unconcern.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A single point was doubtful. For the success of the man&oelig;uvre
it was indispensable that the other countries prosecute their
refractory citizens in the same fashion.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Well, what the French Republic had premeditated, Holland,
England, and even Germany had the decency to be unwilling
to undertake. The venerable monarchies did not yield to
the solicitations of the young republic, which dreamed of reconstituting
in an inverse sense the <i>Internationale</i>. There were parleyings
to this end, but they came to nothing. The hunt of the
free man was not decreed by all Europe. Our fallen democracy
realised from that moment that she could not do worse than the
worst autocracies.... The order was given to set us at large.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The politico-judiciary machination had miscarried. All it
had been able to do was to hold us a month in jail, and gall our
wrists slightly with the infamous irons....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In making arbitrary arrests, our masters, for all their excitement,
had no illusions. They knew very well that they would
be forced, in the end, to restore to liberty men against whom not
a single specific fact could be adduced; but they said to themselves
this, &#8216;Mazas will calm them!&#8217; Now Mazas calms nothing
at all....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is just the opposite that happens. Deranged in their habits,
perturbed in their affairs, losing often their means of subsistence,
those who are victims of the provocative raids go out of prison
more rebellious than they entered it....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The little ones are hungry in the house, the baker refuses
credit, the landlord threatens eviction, the employer has given
another the job.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Rage mounts. It overflows. Some commit suicide by an
overt act; and, surely, the least sturdy take a step forward. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
timid grow bold. In the solitude of the cell logical thought has
gone back to causes, has deduced responsibilities.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Ideas become clarified. The man who has been incarcerated
for the platonic crime of subversive social love learns hatred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among other questionable repressive measures may be mentioned
the famous &#8220;trial of the thirty&#8221; (<i>proc&egrave;s des trente</i>), embracing
several of the theoricians, dilettanti, and litt&eacute;rateurs which
resulted, necessarily, in acquittal, but which left much bad feeling
behind; the &#8220;trial of the forty&#8221; (<i>proc&egrave;s des quarante</i>); the
condemnation of Zo d&#8217;Axa and his managing editor, Matha, to
eighteen months of prison and a 3,000-franc fine; the expulsion of
the litt&eacute;rateur Alexandre Cohen and the art critic F&eacute;lix F&eacute;n&eacute;on;
in the winter of 1900-01&mdash;to pass over the intervening period&mdash;a
long-drawn-out series of wholesale <i>rafles</i> made, nominally, to
suppress the bands of thieves and thugs who had grown numerous
and insolent during the comparative immunity of the preceding
summer, in reality quite as much to enable the police
to locate anew the <i>camarades</i> of whom they had lost track during
their preoccupation with the Exposition; countless perquisitions
and preventive arrests throughout the length and breadth of
France just before the last visit of the czar; and in the spring
of 1904 the turning over of Russian refugees to the Russian police,&mdash;so
many arbitrary and oppressive acts which will bear, if they
have not already borne, their inevitable fruit of hatred and revolt.</p>

<p>For these superfluous persecutions of the anarchists it is sometimes
the police and sometimes the ministry that is responsible;
which it is not always easy to determine, owing to the close connection
between the French national and the Paris municipal
governments.</p>

<p>If it has never been conclusively proved that a ministry has gone
to the extent of organising riotings<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and bogus anarchist attempts
(as capitalists have been known to organise strike violence) in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
order to maintain itself in power, to further a domestic project,
bolster up a foreign policy, or win in advance the moral support
of the community for a contemplated rigorous suppression of free
assembling and free speech, there have been times, as is more
than hinted at in Zola&#8217;s <i>Paris</i>, when a ministry has been publicly
accused and currently believed to have done these things.</p>

<p>According to M. Rochefort, who makes a specialty of launching
sensational hypotheses,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> the attempts of Vaillant and Salsou<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
(by which practically no damage was done) were prepared by the
police, acting under government orders. These charges are not
to be taken more seriously, of course, than others from the same
charlatanical source. They are, perhaps, their own best refutation.
On the other hand, it has been proved over and over again
that not only cabinet ministers, but politicians in general, as well
as financiers and journalists,&mdash;all those, in a word, who &#8220;fish
in troubled waters,&#8221;&mdash;sometimes act in collusion with the police
in turning street disturbances, even at the risk of bloodshed, to
their own selfish or partisan advantage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as if it were not enough to be able to repose on
laws of exception that belong logically to the worst monarchies,
the government has an unfortunate way of straining legality, ever
and anon, even to the breaking point.</p>

<p>Such governmental acts as the transference of papers taken
from nihilist refugees in Paris (1890) to the Russian authorities
in order to enable the Russian police to arrest nihilists living in
Russia; the prohibition of the holding of the International Labour
Congress (1900), which it would have been so easy to suppress
at the first really incendiary utterance; the extradition of the
boy Sipido (the would-be assassin of the then Prince of Wales), a
proceeding of such doubtful legality that the ministry responsible
for it was censured by a vote of 306 to 206 in the Chamber;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the invasion of the <i>Bourse de Travail</i> (1903) by the police, an act
which Premier Combes himself was obliged to denounce in the
Chamber; and the refusal of the Minister of Justice (1904) to
rehabilitate Cyvoct, who adduced overwhelming proofs of his
innocence;&mdash;all these are fair samples of the far from edifying
means the authorities are constantly employing to secure respect
for the law.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that the servant will be more scrupulous
than the master, and we long ago became accustomed to the idea
that it takes a knave to catch a knave. Nevertheless, it is impossible
not to experience a sensation of disgust at the vileness of
some of the methods to which the police descend whenever anarchists
are concerned.</p>

<p>The police chieftains exaggerate (if they do not deliberately
aggravate) the gravity of the public peril (as a wily physician
might exaggerate the gravity of an illness) in order to win from
their ministers the praise and gratitude which mean for them enlarged
brigades, increase of secret funds, and individual promotion.</p>

<p>The rank and file of the police, feeling a similar necessity of
making a good showing with their immediate superiors, entrap
anarchists into street disturbances or violations of the common law,
and fabricate, with the aid of false witnesses, fictitious crimes
for the suspects on their lists who are not obliging enough to make
incendiary speeches or commit violence. They invade the privacy
of their homes on the flimsiest pretexts; slander them to their
<i>compagnes</i>, their neighbours, and their friends; poison the minds
of their <i>conci&egrave;rges</i>, their landlords, and their employers against
them; in short, they render their lives generally unlivable by mean
and meddling tricks.</p>

<p>This is no imaginative sketch,&mdash;so far from it that, if the police
should take it into their heads, during one of the anarchist flurries
which occur periodically, to make a descent upon the lodgings
of the writer, who is anything but an anarchist, he would probably
be imprisoned (or, at least, confined preventively) for the sole
offence of having in his possession the numerous red-covered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
volumes, brochures, caricatures, placards, and <i>chansons</i> which
he has found it necessary to collect in the preparation of this book.
If he were a Frenchman, he would certainly have much difficulty
in avoiding temporary confinement under such circumstances.
Being an American, he might escape with being courteously,
but strenuously, requested to cross the border.</p>

<p>This elaborate spy system, this shrewdness, chicanery, and,
not to mince words, villany on the part of the police, is, after all,
more or less futile. It serves no great purpose in the suppression
of the <i>propagande par le fait</i>.</p>

<p>It is well enough for a police prefect to boast publicly, as did
M. Andrieux, back in the eighties, of the ease with which he
penetrates the meetings of the groups, and recruits spies among
the <i>camarades</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and to shake his sides over the fine trick he plays
on the <i>camarades</i> in conducting a journal<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> for them with funds
provided by the state.</p>

<p>Such boasting and such self-gratulatory chuckling are well
enough in their way; but they are rather idle in view of the looseness
of organisation of the groups, which any one, if he dissemble
ever so little, may frequent, and the insignificance and unreliability
of the information obtained from such easily recruited spies. Besides,
there is a class of anarchists who become police spies, nominally,
for the express purpose of leading the police astray by false
information. Controlling one journal is not controlling all, and a
controlled journal is not less a propagandist force because the
public money goes (however secretly) to the making of it. M.
Andrieux&#8217;s <i>La R&eacute;volution Sociale</i> not only preached anarchy,
but preached it (here the police short-sightedness appears) very
effectively. It converted some of those who have since become
the most feared of militant propagandists, and goaded certain of
the previously converted into action.</p>

<p>Overt acts are seldom, if ever, arranged in the groups. Vaillant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
did not breathe a word of his projected attempt against the
Chamber of Deputies to his group of Choisy-le-Roi. It is the
exception rather than the rule when a really dangerous character
is an assiduous frequenter of the groups; and, if he is, he does
not often take the group members into his confidence. The
&#8220;conspiracy&#8221; which is bruited about at every fresh anarchist
attempt is rarely proved in France, for the very good reason that
in France it rarely exists outside of the excited imagination
of the frightened public and the professional suspiciousness
of the detective and judge. &#8220;Why will they prate of plots?&#8221;
says Zo d&#8217;Axa. &#8220;There is something better. There is an idea
which is alive and stirs, and which is making its way on every
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is well enough, again, for the anthropometric expert, M.
Bertillon (since it seems to amuse him), to enrich his criminal
museum with photographs, relics, and statistics of the militant
and non-militant anarchists who are brought his way by the
police <i>rafles</i>; but what, after all, does it profit him to know the
&#8220;bigness of the skull, the standing height, the sitting height, the
size of the right ear and the left foot,&#8221; so that &#8220;he has no instrument
to register,&#8221; to borrow Zo d&#8217;Axa&#8217;s pregnant phrase, &#8220;the
significance of a shoulder-shrug&#8221;?</p>

<p>The police may plume themselves on knowing the anarchists&#8217;
resorts, faces, and aliases, and their tricks of cipher and invisible
ink. But this police knowledge of the anarchists is offset by
the anarchists&#8217; knowledge of the police.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> It is diamond cut diamond
in this respect.</p>

<p>In 1901 a caf&eacute; gar&ccedil;on, acting on a wager, mounted the step of
President Loubet&#8217;s state carriage, and dropped in the president&#8217;s
lap a mysterious bundle which contained a photograph of the
gar&ccedil;on&#8217;s little daughter. The bundle might as easily have contained
a bomb, and all Paris shuddered.</p>

<p>After the great <i>rafle</i> of April, 1892, this same M. Loubet (then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
a minister), relying on the assurance of the police, proclaimed
to the <i>bourgeoisie</i> that they might sleep in peace for a time, since
all the dangerous anarchists were under lock and key. Four
days later the V&eacute;ry restaurant was dynamited precisely as it had
been predicted that it would be, whence arose, as the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>
exultantly and maliciously remarked at the time, &#8220;a new and
capital word, <i>V&eacute;ryfication</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody&#8217;s shoulder-shrug had not been taken account of.</p>

<p>The police expert knowledge of the anarchists, much as it is
vaunted, has not sufficed to prevent numerous overt anarchist acts
in the immediate past; and there is little reason to believe it
can prevent the next overt act to which a resolute man may make
up his mind.</p>

<p>In carefully guarding dynamite from theft, the French police
have rendered a real service to the public safety. But until the
revolver and the poniard, which are surer than dynamite of their
chosen victims, can be submitted to a similar control, the greatest
service the police can render against the <i>propagande par le
fait</i> would seem to be the purely negative one of not exasperating
anarchists indiscriminately and unnecessarily, and of not brutally
crowding them to the wall.</p>

<p>The injustice of courts, the deceitfulness of ministries, the corruption
of parliament, and the unscrupulousness of the police,
as well as the inequalities of society, are important factors in the
formation of the &#8220;<i>catastrophards</i>,&#8221; or propagandists <i>par le fait</i>.
But they all become insignificant before the passion for martyrdom,
which has always, in some form or other, possessed a minority
of the human race.</p>

<p>The French propagandists <i>par le fait</i>, from Ravachol to Baumann,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
may have grievously deluded themselves; but they have
unquestionably believed themselves to be apostles honoured in
being set apart for martyrdom.</p>

<p>The <i>stigmata</i> are many and unmistakable. They have had
the singleness of purpose and the merciless logic of zealots. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
have preached in season and out of season,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> before judges, in
prisons, and at the guillotine. They have consecrated the time
allotted for their own defence to the defence of anarchist tenets,
have accepted advocates under protest, and have refused to sign
requests for the commutation of their sentences. They have
borne the odium of deeds of which they were not guilty, because
they thereby secured a pulpit for their preaching, and left the real
authors free to operate. They have held it sweet to die for the
faith. They have displayed, in the awful presence of the knife,
the trance-like ecstasy of the illuminate.</p>

<p>In Part I. of his powerful two-part drama, <i>Au-dessus des Forces
Humaines</i>, the hero of which is a dynamiter, the great-minded
Norseman, Bj&ouml;rnson, has emphasised this fact, that it is among
the propagandists <i>par le fait</i> of anarchy that we must look for the
modern martyrs, for the men who witness their faith with their
blood, who sacrifice themselves unreservedly for their fellow-men,
who welcome death with smiles and outstretched arms because
they are confident that their martyrdom will usher in the redemption
of mankind.</p>

<p>Zola and a host of lesser literary lights have been emphasising
the same fact in France.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I know Vaillant,&#8221; says one of the characters of Victor Barrucand&#8217;s
novel <i>Avec le Feu</i>. &#8220;He is afflicted with a hypertrophy
of the sentiments. He believes in nature, in humanity, in justice.
He hopes for the reign of the entities. He is the embodiment
of disinterestedness. He wanted to act. Like a brave bull, he
charged the imaginary obstacle.... He is sincere, he carries
his faith like a torch, he would set the world on fire by way of
persuasion.... He is generous, sanguine, sentimental,&mdash;the
typical French revolutionist.&#8221;</p>

<p>And of Emile Henry, author of the explosion of the <i>Caf&eacute; Terminus</i>,
Zo d&#8217;Axa writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I hear him still, little more than a child, but already grave,
self-centred, and close-mouthed, sectarian even, as all those forcibly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
become whose faith is troubled by no doubts, those who see&mdash;hypnotised,
may I say?&mdash;the end, and then reason, judge, and
decide with mathematical implacability. He believed firmly
in the advent of a future society, logically constructed and harmoniously
beautiful. What he reproached me for was not counting
enough on the regeneration of the race, not referring everything
to the ideal standard of anarchy. Apparent contradictions
shocked his logical sense. He was astounded that any one
who came to realise the baseness of an epoch could continue to
take any pleasure therein.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ferociousness of the self-styled conservators, who made
it their business to hang and burn witches, engendered the
morbid exaltation that made inoffensive, impressionable people
accuse themselves of being witches. The logical and inevitable
counterpart of a Saul of Tarsus breathing threatenings and
slaughter is a Stephen beholding the heavens opened. It has
always been so, and probably always will be.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guillotine is the nimbus of the saints of this new religion,&#8221;
writes F&eacute;lix Dubois, a declared opponent of anarchy, in <i>Le P&eacute;ril
Anarchiste</i>; and this revised version of the venerable proverb,
&#8220;The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church,&#8221; <i>donne &agrave;
penser</i>. It makes one query whether the fanaticism of this latter-day
sect has not been inflamed rather than allayed by every
anarchist head that has fallen. Fancy the feelings of a fervent,
conscientious anarchist assisting at the public decapitation of
one of his coreligionists. Zola has described in unforgettable
pages the entry of the contagion of martyrdom into the system
of his sincere, learned, and great-souled anarchist character,
Guillaume Froment, at the execution of Froment&#8217;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Ah! the dumb stroke, the heavy shock of the knife! Guillaume
heard it penetrate far into this quarter of want and work,
heard it resound in the inmost recesses of the wretched lodgings,
where, at this hour, thousands of workers were rising for the
hard labour of the day. It took on there a formidable meaning.
It told the exasperation of injustice, the madness of martyrdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the agonising hope that the blood shed would hasten
the victory of the disinherited.&#8221;</p>

<p>So long as the guillotining of the anarchists is as dispassionate
as that of other killers of their kind, the guillotined are exalted
into martyrs by their coreligionists alone. But when, as in the
case of Vaillant, who had destroyed no life, the evident purpose of
the courts is to wreak vengeance, not to deal justice, and when
legal forms are stretched, if not completely snapped, by the weight
of popular prejudice and passion with its old, old cry of &#8220;Crucify,
crucify!&#8221; then, not only the sectaries of anarchy, but revolutionists
of every shade, and all those who, while not revolutionists,
are not quite ready to subscribe to the formula that society, like
the king, &#8220;can do no wrong,&#8221; are pained and shocked. These
last add, unconsciously perhaps, several rays to the halos of martyrdom
about the heads of the anarchist thus wronged; and the
cause of a single tiny sect is confounded for the time being with the
cause of the oppressed at large.</p>

<p>The apotheosis of Vaillant is one of the most significant phenomena
of modern times. His fate was sincerely and widely deplored
in literary and artistic circles and by reputable contributors (if
not by editors) in even the capitalistic press.</p>

<p>The spontaneous public pilgrimage to his burial-place, the
Champ de Navets, took the police so completely by surprise that
they were not prepared to arrest it. A stone, inscribed &#8220;<i>Labor
improbus omnia vincit</i>,&#8221; was hastily erected over his grave while
its guardians were at breakfast.</p>

<p>Although it was midwinter, bunches of fresh flowers were fairly
showered upon the mound. These and the wreaths of immortelles
and artificial flowers, which the French so much affect as
funeral tributes, were nearly all accompanied by striking legends.
A significant one of these read: &#8220;Glory to thee who wast great.
I am only a child, but I will avenge thee.&#8221; There was also a
symbolic crown of thorns.</p>

<p>The scenes that were enacted over this anarchist grave were of
a poignant, mystic, almost uncanny intensity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>An aged man raised a babe above the heads of the crowd, and
said impressively, &#8220;Behold the tomb of the martyr!&#8221;</p>

<p>A labourer lifted his voice to utter five simple terrible words,
&#8220;Vaillant, thou shalt be avenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>A blind man declaimed: &#8220;In its lethargy the people is like a
person buried alive. It wakes sometimes in the night of the tomb,
and convulsively strains to break the planks of its coffin. From
the depths of darkness I have heard thy cry of rage and of despair,
O Vaillant! Thou hast threatened the powerful, those
who live on the people and serve them not. Thy arm was
raised, but thou wast thine only victim; and now earth fills thy
mouth. Alas!&#8221;</p>

<p>A ragged snail-gatherer led the crowd to the spot (a hollow
against the wall) where a basket of the clotted blood that had
flowed from the severed head had been hidden. Men, women,
and children knotted lumps of the ensanguined sawdust in their
handkerchiefs and besmeared their hands.</p>

<p>A fierce handbill, &#8220;<i>A Carnot le Tueur</i>,&#8221; was distributed broadcast.
Two red flags were planted on the grave, and a black flag
was unfurled, bearing the inscription, &#8220;<i>Vive la Mort!</i>&#8221;</p>

daughter, Sidonie, who was adopted by the <i>camarades</i>, plays a

<p class="captionc">A STREET RIOT</p></div>

<p>The anniversary of the death of Ravachol is celebrated by a
pilgrimage of the faithful to the tomb of Diderot, who is regarded
as a precursor of anarchism (Montbrison, where Ravachol is
buried, being too far away for Parisians); and every anniversary
of the deaths of those who have died for the cause and every
funeral of a <i>camarade</i> is made a pretext for keeping alive the
morbid cult. But the great saint day of the French anarchist
calendar is the 11th of November, the anniversary of the
anarchist executions at Chicago.</p>

<p>All anarchistic (one might almost say all revolutionary) Europe
honestly believes&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly history has yet,
perhaps, to decide&mdash;that the Chicago hanging was as flagrant
a violation of human rights, and the preceding trial as disgraceful
a travesty of justice, as the worst absolute monarchy has ever
had the audacity to perpetrate. Whatever the influence of this
dramatic execution may have been in America, it was highly
inflammatory in Europe. Under a practically free immigration
system, America will be indeed fortunate if she does not, sooner
or later, import long-stored-up rancour, originating from this
event.</p>

<p>In the rest of Europe, as in France; in Russia, Germany, and
Austria, in Italy and Spain, the violent anarchist acts of the last
twenty-five years have been, broadly speaking, so many reprisals
for real or fancied injuries suffered at the hands of government
or society.</p>

<p>It is as nearly proved as a thing that is not susceptible of mathematical
proof well can be that the almost complete immunity
of England from anarchist violence (the Fenian attempts can
hardly be so classed) has been due, in part at least, to the relative
liberty of speech, press, and assemblage she has accorded,&mdash;accorded
with an almost heroic consistency, in view of the pressure
European governments have brought to bear upon her to change
her policy. And it is surely something other than mere chance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
that so large a proportion of the propagandists <i>par le fait</i> hail
from Italy. The unconcerned fashion in which the Italian peasants
and labourers&mdash;at Milan, at Carrara, in Sicily&mdash;have been
given cold lead when they have had the effrontery to ask for bread,
and the medi&aelig;val tortures, a hundred times worse than death,
inflicted on Passanante<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and his successors, under the hypocritical
guise of clemency and humanity, have acted naturally enough as
provocations toward anarchism rather than restraints against it.</p>

<p>The following account of the fate which awaited Bresci appeared
in the Paris <i>Matin</i> immediately after his condemnation had been
pronounced:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The penalty of imprisonment for life which has fallen upon
Bresci is very rigorous, and will be aggravated by solitary confinement
day and night.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The condemned man will probably be taken to the <i>bagne</i> of
St. Etienne, where he will be clothed in the black and yellow
striped prison uniform. During the first years he will occupy
a cell two and a half metres long and one metre wide, which has
never more than a half-light. Later he will be transferred to a
cell a little larger and fully lighted. A table, slightly inclined,
half a metre wide, will serve him for bed and furniture. His
food will be bread and water once a day only. The jailers will
hand it in to him through a hole covered with coloured glass, which
permits them to see the prisoner without being seen by him.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The days must pass in absolute silence. The punishments
which threaten the prisoner who does not submit to this terrible
r&eacute;gime are: I. The &#8220;strait-jacket&#8221; (<i>chemise de force</i>). II.
Irons which bind the hands to the feet, holding the body bent
forward. III. The <i>lit de force</i>, a wooden box exactly like a coffin,
pierced at the lower end with two holes for the feet. The legs
cannot be moved, and the arms are held motionless by the <i>chemise
de force</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;After ten years of this r&eacute;gime the prisoner is allowed to work
during the day; but at night he returns to isolation and silence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Neither visits nor letters&mdash;nothing&mdash;can penetrate this tomb till
the day when death or madness comes to deliver him who inhabits
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above is given for what it is worth without a guarantee
of the strict accuracy of every detail. But the <i>Matin</i> is not a revolutionary
sheet, and would seem to have no good reason for misrepresentation.
If only one-half of what it reveals is true, the
crime of the Italian government will seem to many more heinous
than the worst thing the anarchists have ever done or been
accused of doing. No wonder Bresci contrived to put himself
out of the way before a year had elapsed, and little wonder that
the friends of Bresci have threatened reprisals.</p>

<p>The folly of taking official cognisance of the expression of incendiary
views was signally demonstrated at the time of the last
visit of the czar to France, when the poet Laurent Tailhade
was sentenced to a year of prison and a 1,000-franc fine for
a prose-poem glorifying regicide, published in <i>Le Libertaire</i>.
This article would have been seen, had the authorities but had
the tact to ignore it, only by the few regular readers of <i>Le
Libertaire</i>, and would have been <i>read through</i>, it is safe to say, only
by a small and unexcitable minority of these; for M. Tailhade is
characterised by a style that is incomprehensible, save to the <i>lettr&eacute;s</i>.
But the author must needs be haled into court;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and, presto!
Paris and the provinces are in an uproar. Well-known literary
and artistic personalities&mdash;Zola, Gustave Kahn, Frantz Jourdain,
E. Ledrain, and Jean Marestan among them&mdash;testify for
their brother craftsman in person, and Mirbeau, De H&eacute;r&eacute;dia,
and Anatole France by letter. The auditors applaud the culprit&#8217;s
utterances, bear him away, after the announcement of the verdict,
in triumph, and hold banquets in his honour. The dangerous
article, or at least its incriminated passages, and the proceedings
of the court are published, in spite of the fact that such publication
is expressly forbidden by law, throughout the length and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
breadth of France; and all the papers teem with <i>chroniques</i>, leading
articles, and skits upon Tailhade or anarchism. Indignation
meetings are held in every corner of Paris, and resolutions of
protest are passed by socialists, free thinkers, and simple republicans,
and even by Masonic lodges.</p>

<p>The obscure <i>Libertaire</i> is given an enormous quantity of free
advertising, the anarchist propaganda is carried on by its enemies,
and a martyr is made of a man with no special vocation for martyrdom.
To be sure, the offender is in durance for a twelve-month,
but he is not silent; and nobody is deterred from following
his example. A clearer instance of making a mountain out of a
molehill it would be hard to find.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE first anarchist I ever knew in any country was a dear,
grandfatherly American workingman in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, who conducted me, the Sunday following
our chance meeting, to an ethical culture society in Dorchester on
purpose to show me how children should be taught to be good.</p>

<p>The second was a young doctor of philosophy, dreaded by reputable
Boston for his well-documented <i>sans-g&ecirc;ne</i>, who chanced
to be rusticating on a farm where I spent ten days with a gang of
a dozen city street boys. I found him infinitely gentle and kind;
and it was he of all the farm household who came to relieve me
one night while I was keeping an anxious bedside vigil beside one
of the boys, who had received an accidental injury to the head
that threatened to prove dangerous.</p>

<p>These my first two experiences with anarchist types were scarcely
of a nature to dismay me, nor have I ever found anything dismaying
in the private characters of the anarchists I have since
known in the Old World.</p>

<p>In an every way remarkable study of the anarchist temperament,
based on a thorough investigation of anarchists of many
professions and all stations in life, A. Hamon, author of <i>La
France Sociale et Politique</i> and <i>Une Psychologie du Militaire
Professionnel</i>, has arrived at these suggestive conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The positive method confirmed by the rational method enables
us to establish an ideal type of anarchist whose mentality
is the aggregate of common psychic characteristics. Every anarchist
partakes sufficiently of this ideal type to make it possible
to differentiate him from other men. The typical anarchist,
then, may be defined as follows: a man perceptibly affected by
the spirit of revolt under one or more of its forms,&mdash;opposition,
investigation, criticism, innovation,&mdash;endowed with a strong love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of liberty, egoistic, or individualistic, and possessed of great curiosity,&mdash;a
keen desire to know. These traits are supplemented
by an ardent love of others, a highly developed moral sensitiveness,
a profound sentiment of justice, an alert logical faculty, and
pronounced combative tendencies.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Such is the average psychic type of the anarchist. He is,
to summarise, a person rebellious, liberty-loving, at once individualistic
and altruistic, enamoured of justice, and imbued with
missionary zeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>To these conclusions every one who has been privileged to know
well any number of anarchists will be likely to subscribe. And,
if M. Hamon, instead of extending his investigations to all sorts
and conditions of anarchists, had limited them to the propagandists
<i>par le fait</i>, his conclusions would not have been essentially different.
He would probably have felt constrained to admit that the
&#8220;ardent love of others&#8221; and the &#8220;profound sentiment of justice&#8221;
were curiously blended with petty cravings for notoriety or large
desires for glory; the &#8220;missionary zeal,&#8221; with a reticence amounting
to mystification about matters of purely personal concern or
projects of violence; and the &#8220;highly developed moral sensitiveness,&#8221;
with a seemingly contradictory moral callousness regarding
the means permissible to attain an end. But, on the other hand,
M. Hamon would surely have added these sterling qualities: a
rare love of animals, surpassing sweetness in all the ordinary relations
of life, exceptional sobriety of demeanour, frugality and
regularity, austerity even, of living, and courage beyond compare.</p>

<p>Ravachol, the most difficult of all the French propagandists
<i>par le fait</i> to comprehend, Ravachol who never allowed (no more
than a great financier might) a sentiment of humanity to interpose
when the success of a plan was at stake, who never showed
a gleam of remorse for his murder of the miser hermit of Chambles
and the pillaging for jewels of the tomb of the Marquise de la
Rochetaille,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>&mdash;Ravachol was by the testimony of all who knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
him well, even his enemies, an unusually kind-hearted man where
the Cause&mdash;I had almost said where politics&mdash;was not concerned.
In his young manhood he supported his mother and younger
brother, and treated them with the greatest consideration. He
was fond of children, and remonstrated fiercely against cruelty
to animals. The presiding judge tried in vain to wrest from the
little son of Ravachol&#8217;s <i>compagne</i> some hint of brutality on Ravachol&#8217;s
part. &#8220;<i>Il &eacute;tait tr&egrave;s doux avec maman et avec moi</i>&#8221; was all
the boy could be got to say; and the only time Ravachol broke
down during his detention and trial was at the sight of this little
one. Chaumartin, who had betrayed Ravachol from fear or some
baser motive, said on the witness-stand, &#8220;He taught my little
children to read, and cut out pictures for them&#8221;; and Ravachol
forgave this same Chaumartin his baseness in open court.</p>

<p>Only a short time before the explosion of the rue de Clichy,
Ravachol escorted to a shoe store a pitiable beggar girl he had
chanced upon in the street, and saw her provided with a new pair
of shoes, for which he paid seven francs.</p>

<p>The charities and compassions of Pini, and Duval&#8217;s more than
platonic solicitude for the welfare of working-women, have been
previously noted.</p>

<p>Decamp, though he earned barely fr. 2.50 per day, and had a
wife and three children to provide for, adopted a homeless six-year-old
child to save it from vagabondage.</p>

<p>Faugoux, who was given twenty years of hard labour for stealing
dynamite, wrote to a <i>camarade</i> regarding the damaging testimony
of one Drouet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As to Drouet, I pardon him his want of frankness regarding
me. He has little instruction, and he hoped in this way to save
himself from the law. This <i>compagnon</i>, although convinced, has
much sentiment for his family; and this is a powerful motive.
When he thought of the struggle and the misery which his wife
and child would have to support, he forgot that he was an anarchist.
Let us not lay it up against him nor refuse him our
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salsou adored, as he was adored by, his father and mother and
his several brothers and sisters. He wrote them often in the years
after he left home for the <i>trimard</i>; and his letters were replete
with affection, notably one in which he acknowledged the photograph

of his mother and
two of the children, Martha
and Henri, playfully calling
the last named &#8220;Henricon.&#8221;
His <i>compagne</i> had no complaint
to make of his treatment
of her, and even his
laundress testified to his
being courteous and kind.</p>

<p>Reader&#8217;s of Zola&#8217;s <i>Germinal</i>
will remember the
anarchist Souvarine&#8217;s affection
for the pet rabbit,
Pologne, and his sorrow
at her death. The point
is well observed. Nearly
every French anarchist,
whether propagandist <i>par
le fait</i> or not, is a defender of the rights of all four-footed things;
and many are strict vegetarians. In her fascinating autobiography,
Louise Michel returns again and again with flaming wrath
to the sufferings of domestic animals.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Under my revolt against the strong,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I find, farther
back than I can remember distinctly, a horror of the tortures
inflicted on dumb beasts. I would have liked to see the animal
defend himself,&mdash;the dog bite the one who abused him, the horse,
bleeding under the lash, trample on his torturer. But always
the dumb beast endures his lot with the resignation of the subdued
races. What an object of pity is the beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>This typical anarchist trait is graphically illustrated by the
following anecdote related by Flor O&#8217;Squarr:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;One day in July I stopped before a book-stall of the rue Ch&acirc;teaudun,
close by the rue Laffitte, when I was joined by an anarchist
who led me before the show window of a bird dealer
a few steps away. There, with a hand that shook, he pointed
out to me some white mice shut up in tiny iron cages that were
provided with squirrels&#8217; wheels, whereon the little beasts galloped
without respite.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;See there,&#8217; moaned the dynamiter, &#8216;tell me if men are not
villains! These poor white mice, so delicate, so pretty, suffer
frightfully, don&#8217;t you know it, churning like that in this instrument
of torture. It gives them nausea and pains in the stomach.&#8217;
He would have strangled the dealer without remorse to avenge
the mice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zola, in his account of the trial of the dynamiter Salvat (<i>Paris</i>),
makes the culprit&#8217;s fellow-workmen testify that he was &#8220;a worthy
man, an intelligent, diligent, and highly temperate workman,
who adored his little daughter, and who was incapable of an
indelicacy or meanness&#8221;; and this characterisation of a bomb-thrower
of fiction might be applied with little change to almost
every real bomb-thrower who has operated in France. Scarcely
one appears to have been&mdash;the <i>propagande</i> apart&mdash;what we call
a &#8220;bad egg&#8221; and the French call a &#8220;<i>mauvais sujet</i>&#8221; or to have
had a bad disposition. There is scarcely a drunkard, a gambler,
a libertine, or a domestic tyrant, in the lot. Indeed, they have
had so few of the vices of genius that one almost sighs over their
essential commonplaceness.</p>

<p>They have nearly all been highly abstemious and nearly all
great readers. Pini&#8217;s living expenses averaged less than three
francs a day, and were no more after a successful theft than
before,&mdash;the best possible proof that he was not given to reckless
dissipation.</p>

<p>Ravachol spent somewhat more than Pini,&mdash;seven or eight
francs a day, on an average,&mdash;but was no hard liver. Philip, one
of the French authors of the explosion at Li&egrave;ge (spring of 1904),
devoted a legacy to the cause. Baumann educated himself in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
evening schools after reaching manhood. Salsou, who had read
the <i>R&eacute;volution Sociale</i> of Proudhon at fifteen, devoted a good part
of his earnings to the purchase of journals and books. He paid
from four to seven francs a week for his lodgings, and lived in
other respects accordingly. Potatoes and onions &#8220;were the chief of
his diet.&#8221; He left his room regularly about seven in the morning,
returned about the same hour at night, and went out very little
evenings even to the group meetings, preferring to stay at home
and read till a late hour. In fact, the only things his associates
found to reproach him for were his over-seriousness and his
taciturnity.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He was an honest, laborious, sober man,&#8221; testified his employer
at his trial, &#8220;and ever ready to do a favour, but very much
shut up in himself,&mdash;not in the least communicative. He passed
for a scholar.&#8221; Whereupon Salsou, referring to his condemnation
at Fontainebleau for having talked of his faith, retorted, &#8220;If
they reproach me with being uncommunicative, it is because I
know what it costs to be communicative.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The aim of the press,&#8221; said Zola, apropos of the public reception
of Salvat&#8217;s attempt (<i>Paris</i>), &#8220;seemed to be to besmirch Salvat,
in order, in his person, to degrade anarchy; and his life was made
out to be one long abomination.... His faults, magnified, were
paraded without the causes that had produced them, and without
the excuse of the environment which had aggravated them. What
a revolt of humanity and justice there was in the soul of Froment,
who knew the true Salvat,&mdash;Salvat, the tender mystic, the chimerical
and passionate spirit, thrown into life without defence, always
weighted down and exasperated by implacable poverty, and finding
his account at last in this dream of restoring the golden age
by destroying the old world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whenever a fresh anarchist trial occurs in France, this inglorious
farce of press vilification is re-enacted. Not content with heaping
on the culprit&#8217;s head all the misdemeanours of which he
has been guilty and many crimes of which he has not been guilty,
the bourgeois organs try to strip him of his one incontrovertible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
attribute,&mdash;courage. They dare&mdash;knowing him well under lock
and key&mdash;to call him &#8220;coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, my respectable, quaking bourgeois, not that! Robber,
murderer, incendiary, fornicator, what you will (if you must
judge by your rule of thumb), but not coward! It is too much!
You cannot deny the dynamiter what you concede to the vilest
criminals and even to the beast of the jungle.</p>

<p>Duval all but killed the police brigadier Rossignol, who attempted
to arrest him. For the judge who tried to worm out of
him proofs of the existence of accomplices, he had this fine epigram:
&#8220;<i>Vous n&#8217;aurez ma langue qu&#8217;avec ma t&ecirc;te</i>.&#8221; Condemned to
death, he refused to sign a petition for clemency. The innocent
Cyvoct, under sentence of death, also refused to sue for pardon.</p>

<p>Two officers were wounded before Francis<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> could be secured
on the Boulevard de Strasbourg, and it took four officers to hold
Parmeggiani.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>Pini had to be lassooed in the heart of Paris like a buffalo of
the plains, and it was only when wounded that he could be retaken
after his escape from Cayenne.</p>

<p>Lorion, advertised everywhere by the police for an incendiary
speech at Roubaix (immediately after his release from a five
years&#8217; imprisonment), openly led a band to the sack of the office
of a Lille newspaper which had treated him as a police spy, and
then made good his escape to Havre; but, determined to purge
away the last vestige of the charge against him, he returned to the
region of Lille, and wounded two officers before he could be taken.</p>

<p>Decamp defended himself, after his cartridges were finished
and his knife gone, with a bayonet,&mdash;which he succeeded in wresting
from one of his assailants,&mdash;until he swooned from loss of
blood. In court he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;You can guillotine me. I prefer it. I have had enough of
your prisons and your <i>bagnes</i>. Off with my head! I do not defend
it. I deliver it, shouting, &#8216;<i>Vive l&#8217;Anarchie!</i>&#8217; What does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
one <i>camarade&#8217;s</i> head more or less amount to, if only our beautiful
Hope spreads!&#8221;</p>

<p>Baumann constituted himself a prisoner, and demanded the
guillotine. Etievant wrote from London a little while before
his attempt:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;We are here in large numbers, the proscribed of all countries,
convinced of the final triumph of Liberty, having made great sacrifices
already for the Idea, and fortifying ourselves with the hope
of rendering service to poor humanity which has limped along
painfully for so many centuries; and yet I begin to doubt that
we have done everything that we might have done and in consequence
everything that we should have done. Would it not have
been better to struggle even unto death there where the hazard
of birth had placed us? Rather than to flee precipitately before
the threats and the blows of authority, would it not have been
better to make the sacrifice of our lives?&#8221; By deliberately returning
to Paris, Etievant answered his own question in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Henry, whose attitude in court was that of a pontiff, &#8220;defended
himself in the street like a little lion,&#8221; says Barrucand. &#8220;He
resisted till he was at the very end of his forces, even under the
heels of the police. Flippant, ferocious, he mocked the officers,
said that he had just arrived from Pekin, and would not give
his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vaillant denounced himself when he stood a fair chance of escape,
and bore himself proudly before his judges and before the
guillotine.</p>

<p>Ravachol, king of cynics, risked discovery in passing the <i>octroi</i>
(city revenue office) with dynamite in his satchel; walked long
distances on foot and rode in jolting omnibuses while carrying
materials that the slightest shock might explode; showed himself
after each of his attempts with an appalling indifference to recognition;
defended himself superbly before the V&eacute;ry restaurant,
whither he had returned for no other apparent purpose than to
finish the conversion of the gar&ccedil;on L&#8217;H&eacute;rot, whom he had found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
sympathetically inclined a fortnight before; advanced to the
guillotine (though bound in a painful and ignoble fashion) singing
the most blasphemous and defiant of all the stanzas of the
venerable <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i>;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> hurled in the teeth of Deibler, the
headsman, the epithet, &#8220;<i>Cochon!</i>&#8221; and, as the knife fell, cried
&#8220;<i>Vive la R&eacute;</i>&#8221;&mdash;The word was never finished. Some of the
bourgeois papers, determined to deprive Ravachol of the cynical
grandeur of his death by making him out a retractor, claimed the
unfinished word to be <i>R&eacute;publique</i> instead of <i>R&eacute;volution</i>.</p>

<p>It is the petty work of little men to call a man a coward who
can die like this. A consummate villain,&mdash;yes, judged by conventional
standards,&mdash;but no coward.</p>

<p>The man who dies like a man&mdash;and let it not be forgotten there
are a hundred and one ways of doing it&mdash;is to be admired for
that, whether he be called John Huss or John Brown, Saint
Stephen or Saint Jean N&eacute;pomuc&egrave;ne, Charles I. or Louis XVI.,
Raleigh or Ravachol, Petronius Arbiter or Louis Lingg.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="dropcap2">O</span>NE of the plainest after-results of the Dreyfus
affair, into which the socialists<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> as well as
the anarchists threw themselves with glee
for the superb opportunity it offered to undermine
patriotism and destroy the army, has been a cleavage between
the more conservative and the more radical elements of the
socialist party.</p>

<p>The primary cause of this division may be found in the fact
that two socialists (one of whom, M. Millerand, had previously
been decidedly militant) accepted portfolios in the coalition ministry
which supervised the Dreyfus trial at Rennes and which survived
it for a time. This official service had such a sobering effect,
both upon the ministers themselves and upon their immediate
following, that their socialism became frankly opportunist; and
the more radical and <i>doctrinaire</i> among their fellow-socialists
felt compelled, because of this, to withdraw from them their support.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
In like manner the socialist deputies who have helped to
maintain the Combes ministry have been constrained to a similar
opportunism. So it has come about that the French socialists,

who formerly were, broadly speaking, all revolutionary,
are now divided into the two distinct
and even hostile camps<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> of evolutionary socialists
and revolutionary socialists.</p>

<p>With the evolutionary socialists&mdash;who are,
perhaps, for being the less logical only the
more philosophical&mdash;this book has, from the
very nature of its subject, nothing to do.
The revolutionary socialists alone concern us.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that <i>doctrinaire</i> socialism
and <i>doctrinaire</i> anarchism are at opposite
poles of the world of thought. Absolute authority is as much
the ideal of the one as absolute liberty is the ideal of the other.
For the anarchist the betterment of society depends primarily on
the betterment of the individual, while for the socialist the betterment
of the individual depends primarily on the betterment
of society. The complete realisation of socialism presupposes
the perfection of human machinery, and the complete realisation
of anarchism the perfection of human nature. The theories of
the vicarious atonement and salvation by character present,
in another field, a somewhat analogous contrast. Nevertheless,
these theoretically antithetical systems find in their antagonism
to actual conditions so many points of contact that it is
not always easy for an outsider to determine whether a given
revolutionist is an anarchist or a revolutionary socialist, and not
always easy, one more than half suspects, for a revolutionist
to determine himself in which of the two classes he really belongs.</p>

<p>The revolutionary socialists, like the anarchists, are high-minded
dreamers, who are bent on procuring happiness for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the human kind. Unlike the anarchists, they participate in
elections, and do not desire the abolition of the state (as
is indicated by their use of the word <i>citoyen</i>, which the anarchists
abhor); but they do wish for the downfall of the present
state (with whose bad faith and impotence they are thoroughly
disgusted) as the first step towards setting up the socialistic
state, and they hold collective revolt the most likely
means of effecting this downfall; all of which, in troubled
periods, amounts to very much the same thing practically as
if they abjured the state altogether. Like the anarchists, they
demand the abolition of private property, and they are opposed,
like them, to charity (as the term is popularly understood), to
patriotism, and to armies. Like the anarchists, furthermore
(though this does not seem to be a logical necessity for either),
they are violently opposed to the church; and they are (with
less inevitableness than the anarchists in the same matter) more
or less hostile to marriage.</p>

<p>They do not advocate the individual
overt act of violence (though they often
sympathise with it when committed), and,
hoping for social salvation from social machinery,
neglect the propaganda <i>par l&#8217;exemple</i>.
With these exceptions their methods
of propaganda are identical with those
of the anarchists. They dispense the word
orally, as the anarchists dispense it by
means of mass meetings, <i>punchs-conf&eacute;rences</i>,
<i>soupes-conf&eacute;rences</i>, <i>matin&eacute;es-conf&eacute;rences</i>,
<i>ballades propagandistes</i>, <i>soir&eacute;es familiales</i>, and amateur
theatricals, and have a similar <i>penchant</i> for the <i>chanson populaire</i>.</p>

<p>The socialists have their special books and brochures and
ingenious methods of circulating them and their special propagandist
press, which includes several dailies, as well as weeklies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and monthlies,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and serves as a bond of union and a means of
communication between individuals and groups; and they make
a copious use of placards, manifestos,
pictures, artistic posters, and souvenir
postal cards.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Anarchists and socialists unite in anti-clerical
and anti-militarist mass meetings,
in interfering riotously with public
worship, in shouting, <i>A bas l&#8217;Arm&eacute;e!</i>
and <i>A bas la Patrie!</i> They also unite
in distributing to the conscripts manuals
reciting their duties in the regiments,
chief of which are disobedience
and desertion; and they commemorate
together many of the same anniversaries,
especially those of the <i>Mur des F&eacute;d&eacute;r&eacute;s</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> (May) and of
Etienne Dolet<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> (August). It is at election times mainly that
they try conclusions fiercely with each other, because of their
antagonistic sentiments towards the exercise of the vote.</p>

<p>The revolutionary socialists esteem lightly trade-unions, except
as a means of coercing ministries to paternalism, and take little
interest in co-operation<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> as practised at present; but they have
something of the same faith as the anarchists that <i>la gr&egrave;ve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>,
which several of their congresses have indorsed, and <i>la pan-coop&eacute;ration</i>
will coincide with the revolution.</p>

<p>In a certain sense&mdash;and not so very far-fetched a sense, either&mdash;every
political party in Paris is revolutionary, inasmuch as all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the &#8220;outs&#8221; are willing to resort to revolutionary methods to overturn
the <i>statu quo</i> and all the &#8220;ins&#8221; would be willing to resort

respective dispensations if, by a turn of
the wheel of fortune, they should become
the &#8220;outs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anarchists and the socialists are
by no means the only bodies who find
the Third Republic detestable, and who,
to make way with it, would gladly descend
into the street. The royalists and
imperialists are reactionary revolutionists,
only deterred from insurrection and
a <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i> by the absence of the magnetic
man and the propitious occasion. The nationalists would
pause at nothing that would enable them to substitute a plebiscitary
for the present parliamentary republic, and the anti-Semites

<i>L&#8217;Autorit&eacute;</i>, <i>L&#8217;Intransigeant</i>, <i>La Libre Parole</i>,

<p>Some time before his expulsion D&eacute;roul&egrave;de said to his electors:
&#8220;There is no other means of safety than a revolution at once
popular and military, having at
its head a civilian and a soldier,
both loyally resolved to maintain
the republic. To deliver France
and the republic, there are three
methods possible: the will of a
man (that is, the <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>); the
will of the people (that is, revolution);
the will of the representative
assembly (that is, parliament).
I will do all in my power
to make the last method&mdash;the
most peaceable&mdash;effective; but I
do not greatly count on it, and
I declare myself determined to
venture everything for the triumph of the other two.&#8221;</p>

<span class="captionc">JULES GU&Eacute;RIN</span></div>

<p>D&eacute;roul&egrave;de and Gu&eacute;rin are both in banishment at this moment
for overt acts against the state. And, while the strict legality
of the forms of the high court trial that condemned them is
more than dubious, there is no doubt possible as to their essential
guilt.</p>

<p>While Gu&eacute;rin was holding Fort Chabrol, the Dreyfusard
anarchists were exhorted by the anarchist leader, S&eacute;bastien
Faure, to change their cries of <i>A bas Gu&eacute;rin!</i> to <i>Vive Gu&eacute;rin!</i>
since, whatever the anti-Dreyfusard, anti-Semite rebel might
have been before the siege or might be after it, he was logically
one of them as long as he was defying the authority of the
state.</p>

<p>The fact is that Paris, in spite of her excessive conservatism
in certain directions, has, and ever since the Great Revolution has
had, an <i>&eacute;tat d&#8217;esprit r&eacute;volutionnaire</i>. Paris revolutionists and
Parisians, then, are, in the last analysis, pretty nearly one and
the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap3">&#8220;</span><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE Sorbonne,&#8221; says Eug&egrave;ne Pelletan, &#8220;shines from the
heights through the early mists like the dawn of intelligence.
It is there that the French Revolution was really
born, thence was its point of departure....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;On this sacred mount of the university a philosopher in
monkish garb spoke one day in the open air. What did he
say? It matters little. He said something new, and the multitude
listened because he was the first to defend the claims of
the earth,&mdash;the right of reason to reason; and, while he spoke,
a veiled woman, with lips on fire, clung to the grating of a convent
over yonder, and encouraged him with gestures in default of
words.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The man represents human intellect hampered by the church,
and the woman represents France confined in a cloister; but
Ab&eacute;lard will grow, and will assume day by day, like the Indian
god, a fresh avatar. To-morrow&mdash;for what is to-morrow in the
life of a people?&mdash;he will bear, according to the ironical or severe
humour of France, the name of Rabelais, the name of Descartes,
the name of Rousseau, the name of Voltaire. And, side by side
with him, the Idea, the insulted, the abused Idea, will advance
with slow and tragic steps between two rows of fagots, a flame
in her forehead and her hands at her sides, until the day when
she shall wrest the torch from the executioner, and proclaim herself
Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoever would unfold the progress of the revolutionary spirit
in France from the earliest times through the centuries must needs
write a history of the Sorbonne and of the seat of the Sorbonne,
the <i>Pays Latin</i> (the Latin Quarter).</p>

<p>In the relatively limited area included between Notre Dame,
where the goddess of Reason was enthroned in the Great Revolution;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the Place Maubert,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> with its statue of Etienne Dolet, the sixteenth-century
printer, burned for impiety and atheism; the Square
Monge, with its statue of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon; the Place Monge,
with its statue of Louis Blanc; the Panth&eacute;on, with its memorials
to the intellectual liberators, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, and Voltaire;
the Place de l&#8217;Ecole de M&eacute;decine, with its statue of Danton
doughtily inscribed, &#8220;<i>Pour vaincre les ennemis de la justice, il
faut de l&#8217;audace, encore de l&#8217;audace et toujours de l&#8217;audace</i>&#8221;; the
Place St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s, with its statue of Diderot; and the
Place de l&#8217;Institut, with its statue of Condorcet,&mdash;every inch of
ground is rich in souvenirs of the intellectual history of France
and of the convulsions by which this history&#8217;s various stages have
been marked.</p>

<p>Here on the left bank of the Seine, where Ab&eacute;lard, in the
twelfth century, &#8220;discoursed to all the earth,&mdash;to two popes,
twenty cardinals, and fifty bishops, to all the orders, all the modern
schools which descended from the mountain and inundated
Europe&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> whither came Dante in the fourteenth century for
the lectures of Siger de Brabant; the Greek Lascaris in the fifteenth
and Calvin and Loyola in the sixteenth centuries; where
the <i>trouv&egrave;re</i> Ruteb&oelig;uf in the thirteenth century and the poet
Villon in the fifteenth carried on the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i> and
even the <i>propagande par le fait</i>; where, in the early part of the fifteenth
century, the <i>Cabocherie</i> decreed the reign of virtue and
equality, pillaged the dwellings of the wealthy, and had all things
common; where, in the sixteenth century, the <i>Commune Catholique</i>
was set up at the instigation of an anti-royalist preacher of St.
S&eacute;v&eacute;rin; where, in the same century, Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais, Cl&eacute;ment
Marot, and La Bo&eacute;tie (friend of Montaigne and social democrat
before his time) prepared themselves, in their very different fashions,
to alternately edify and castigate the civilisation of their
epoch, and Ren&eacute; Descartes, in the seventeenth century, to found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
modern philosophy and to destroy scholasticism; where the eighteenth-century
Encyclopedists set themselves to solve the problem
of human destiny, and begot the Revolution; where, in the
century just closed, the trinity of the Coll&egrave;ge de France, Michelet,
Quinet, and Mickiewicz, formed the men who were to set up the
Third Republic on the ruins of the Second Empire,&mdash;in
this intellectual and nerve centre of Paris, of France,
and at intervals of the world, revolutionary action has
been so often suited to the revolutionary thought that no
one dreams of crying out crime or mystery when, in the
course of excavations, human bones are exhumed.</p>

<p>Revolutionary thinking has not been practised with impunity
in the <i>Quartier Latin</i>. From Ab&eacute;lard to Michelet
and Renan, religious, political, and philosophical heresies
have called down ecclesiastical, governmental, and academical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
wrath with the usual result of helping to propagate the
heresies.</p>

<p>Ab&eacute;lard was censured for heterodoxy, hounded from one monastery
to another, and condemned finally to perpetual silence.
Ramus, antagonist of the philosophy of Aristotle, was included
in the massacre of St. Bartholomew. &#8220;In Ramus,&#8221; says Michelet,
&#8220;they fancied they were killing a second Ab&eacute;lard. They
thought to butcher mind.&#8221; Cl&eacute;ment Marot was imprisoned,
and forced to flee from France. Descartes, maltreated by Catholics
and Protestants alike, forbidden to teach, and threatened
with death, took refuge first in Holland and then in Sweden.
Vanini was burned at the stake. Buffon was persecuted for his
<i>Histoire Naturelle</i>, and Montesquieu for his <i>Esprit des Lois</i>.
Michelet, who &#8220;scratched the heavens with his white hand,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
Mickiewicz, Quinet, and Renan were expelled from the Coll&egrave;ge
de France.</p>

<p>There have been periods, it is true, when the university faculties
have been servile and cringing,&mdash;mere tools of the potentates
of church and state,&mdash;and periods when the students have been
craven or lethargic; but these periods are the exceptions. Speaking
broadly, the <i>Quartier</i> has been from first to last a preserve
of free living and free thinking, a stronghold of opposition, a
centre of agitation, and a hot-bed of revolution.</p>

<p>Eug&egrave;ne Pelletan thus describes the students of the university&#8217;s
beginnings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A mixed, vagabond population, drifted together from nobody
could say where, they live by the grace of God, they eat when they
can, they sleep on straw, and carry their begging wallets proudly,
as if conscious they hold there the word of the future.... When
they do not dine, they have the resource of the cabaret; and, always
noisy, always care-free, they prowl about at nightfall, they
force now and then the door of a bourgeois, and, when the watch
rushes to the uproar, they put it to rout, quit with answering
for the misdemeanour to the rector, who invariably exonerates.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Scantily clad and almost vagabonds,&#8221; says another historian
of this early period, &#8220;but not depriving themselves of good cheer,
the future magistrates and theologians, who were to antagonise
in parliament the will of the king, were already revolutionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century the faculties, morally, and the students,
both morally and materially, cast in their lots with the
revolution of Etienne Marcel, who is credited with having invented
the barricade.</p>

<p>Reign succeeded reign, and still the good habit of thrashing
the watch was kept up. Besides, there were battles-royal galore
between the students and the troops of the king.</p>

<p>The students made themselves jugglers, fakirs, and buffoons
on the Pont-Neuf, then a favourite, shop-lined promenade. They
sacked cook-shops and taverns, and levied tribute from belated pedestrians.
The lawless exploits of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, singer of villanelles
to Guillemette, the <i>tapissi&egrave;re</i>, and Jehanneton, the <i>chaperonni&egrave;re</i>,
in the reigns of Charles VII. and Louis XI., have become
legendary.</p>

<p>That other great Fran&ccedil;ois (Rabelais) has portrayed the democratic
and turbulent temper of the students of a somewhat later
period.</p>

<p>During the reign of Louis XIV., the merry, strolling players
and mountebanks, Tabarin and Gaultier-Garguille (the latter the
inventor of the farce), had numerous imitators among the students;
which jovial humour did not prevent the latter from entering
heartily into the <i>Fronde</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> risking their lives on &#8220;the Day of the
Barricades&#8221; and exercising their caustic wit against the court
and the hated foreign minister, Mazarin, in lampoons called
<i>Mazarinades</i>.</p>

<p>The trenchant criticisms and the comprehensive formulas,
which appeared in the Encyclopedists&#8217; published works, captivated
many professors of the university,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> and made a direct and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
profound impression on the students. But it seems to be no exaggeration
to say that it was the caf&eacute;s and cabarets of the Left
Bank rather than the university that fanned the smouldering
flame of discontent into a conflagration of rebellion. In them
the fiercest revolutionary clubs of the epoch had their rendezvous.
At the <i>Caf&eacute; Procope</i>,&mdash;transformed, alas! into a vulgar restaurant
only a year or so back,&mdash;H&eacute;bert presided over a club which burned
before the door the journals found too tame for its ideas, and Danton
met with Marat, Legendre, and Fabre d&#8217;Eglantine; and the
Procope was only one of a score. Indeed, it would take a volume
to do full justice to the part played in French history by
the Latin Quarter caf&eacute;s from 1780 to Napoleon&#8217;s establishment
of himself in power.</p>

<p>Under the Restoration the social and political Utopias of the
Icarians, the Fourierites, and the Saint-Simonians, commanded
the interest, if not the allegiance, of a considerable portion of the
university. &#8220;The new Sorbonne,&#8221; says Vacherot, &#8220;far from
viewing unmoved the liberal movement which was to culminate
in the revolution of July, participated in it actively, lending it
the prestige of its most <i>spirituel</i>, its most serious, and its most
eloquent teaching.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in great part the students, as all know who have followed
the vicissitudes of Marius and Cosette in <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>,
who were responsible for the insurrection of 1830.</p>

<p>It was in the spheres of literature and art, however, where
Romanticism was struggling to supplant Classicism, that the
hottest passions were kindled. The influence of Scott, Byron,
and the rising Hugo dominated, even in the matter of dress.
Romanticists adopted the costumes of Moslems, Corsairs, and
Giaours: the <i>Quartier</i> resembled a fancy-dress ball-room, and
men fought in its streets for their artistic as they had in other
times for their political and religious creeds.</p>

<p>The students of the reign of Louis Philippe have been thus
pictured by De Banville: &#8220;Young, gay, reckless, but possessed of
native distinction, coquettishly arrayed in velvet and all sorts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
original and fancy costumes, capped with Basque <i>b&eacute;rets</i> and
felts <i>&agrave; la</i> Rubens, they went up and down, sauntering, singing,
gazing into space, alone, or in pairs, or in groups, or three by three,
selling their text-books willingly at the old book dealers in order
to enter the cabaret,&mdash;a custom which, as you know, dates from
the twelfth century.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of this same youth and that which came immediately after it
Aur&eacute;lien Scholl writes: &#8220;The young men of the schools thought
solely of f&ecirc;tes and of fun. The <i>Quartier</i> resembled strangely
the <i>Boh&egrave;me</i> of M&uuml;rger,&mdash;<i>la noce</i>, nothing but <i>la noce</i>. The historiographer
of this epoch finds only farces to narrate, and such
farces!&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet the students played almost as large a part in the revolution
of 1848 as in that of 1830. Under their masks of flippancy
they were serious. They had merely been waiting for the strategic
moment and a leader; and, when in 1847 Antonio Watripon,
bent on a &#8220;reawakening of the schools,&#8221; founded a journal, <i>La
Lanterne du Quartier Latin</i>, as a means of organising and directing
the student opposition, they took an active part in the demonstrations
which brought about the downfall of the government
of Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>They sprang to arms again, soon after, against the disillusionising
<i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i> of the third Napoleon, while the workingmen
remained relatively submissive. &#8220;At the news that Louis Napoleon
is getting ready to confiscate the public liberties,&#8221; says Scholl,
&#8220;a wave of indignation sweeps over the length and breadth of
the <i>Quartier</i>. The students invade, and pronounce inflammatory
discourses in, caf&eacute; after caf&eacute;, <i>cr&egrave;merie</i> after <i>cr&egrave;merie</i>. They descend
without hesitation into the street to combat the troops of
the tyrant, and many pay for their heroism with their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The discouragement which followed the complete establishment
of the authority of the usurper naturally gave rise to a sort
of lassitude, which was mistaken by many for sycophancy or indifference,
and was generally regarded as proof positive of the
degeneration of the student type. But the students, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
temporarily silent and outwardly submissive, had not disarmed.
It was not long before Vall&egrave;s, Gambetta, Vermesch, Blanqui,
Rochefort, and scores of others, who participated a little later
in the Commune or in the founding of the Third Republic, were
busily sowing the seeds of disaffection in the cafes; and in 1865
this fresh revolutionary movement was given coherence and direction
by <i>Les Propos de Labienus</i>, the little masterpiece of Rogeard.</p>

<p>It was, in point of fact, mainly in the caf&eacute;s of the Latin Quarter
rather than in the university proper that the revolution of 1871,
as well as that of 1789, was fermented.</p>

<p>In 1866, at the <i>Caf&eacute; de la Renaissance Hell&eacute;nique</i>, a revolutionary
club was formed, consisting of eight persons, the oldest of whom
was barely twenty-two,&mdash;five law students, a medical student, a
painter, and a <i>rentier</i>,&mdash;the first overt act of which was a riotous
protest against the production of Augier&#8217;s <i>La Contagion</i> at the
<i>Od&eacute;on</i>. Most, if not all, of the charter members of this club, which
was soon consolidated with a club of older men meeting at the
<i>Caf&eacute; Serpente</i>, saw the inside of the prison of Ste. P&eacute;lagie before
the Commune was achieved.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The Renaissance,&#8221; says Auguste Lepage in his <i>Caf&eacute;s Artistiques
et Litt&eacute;raires de Paris</i>, &#8220;had a special physiognomy at
the absinthe hour and after dinner. Noisy, uncombed students
entered, mounted to the second floor, got together in groups, and
talked politics or took a turn at billiards. They lighted long pipes,
artistically coloured; and through the smoke clouds might be
heard, together with the voices of the speechifiers, the clicks
of the ivory balls as they met on the green cushions. <i>Etudiantes</i>
accompanied the students. These strikingly dressed girls smoked
cigarettes and occupied themselves with politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>The imperial police had a special fondness for the Renaissance,
and this caf&eacute; shared with the <i>Brasserie de St. S&eacute;v&eacute;rin</i>, after
the Commune was set up, the distinction of being used as a headquarters
by the Communard officials.</p>

<p>The Procope, also affected by police spies, was frequented
by Spuller, Ferry, Floquet, Vermorel, and Gambetta, who preserved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
their liberty on more than one occasion by utilising the
back door, which had rendered a similar service to Danton in
another century.</p>

<p>The <i>Caf&eacute; Voltaire</i> harboured, among others, Gambetta and
Vall&egrave;s, the <i>Caf&eacute; de Buci</i> Vall&egrave;s and Delescluze, and the <i>Brasserie
Audler</i> and the <i>Restaurant Laveur</i> Courbet and his unconventional
intimates.</p>

<p>To summarise: from the time of Ab&eacute;lard&mdash;the Ab&eacute;lard who was
sustained and inspired by the thought of the flaming lips of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
pressed against the convent grating&mdash;to and through the Commune,
the <i>Pays Latin</i> was characterised by a revolutionary spirit which
was composed of three seemingly independent, if not mutually
antagonistic, but, in reality, complementary and vitally interrelated
traits,&mdash;love of laughter, love of liberty, and love of love.</p>

<p>The different persons of this emancipating trinity were equally
potent impellers to Quixotic thought and action; and no one of
the three could have long survived&mdash;such is the French temperament
in or out of the <i>Quartier</i>&mdash;without both of the others.
The Gallic imagination and conscience are dependent on good
cheer and affection; they cease to operate if a fellow may not unbend
in buffoonery with the boys and may not adore a woman.
And, without conscience and imagination, is no revolution.</p>

<span class="captionl">A CAVEAU OF THE LATIN QUARTER<br /><br /></span></span>

has been said
of late years
about the change
which has taken
place in the <i>Pays Latin</i> and in the
student character. The &#8220;old boys&#8221;
tell us, with sneering superiority or
quavering regret, that the <i>Quartier
Latin</i> is no longer what it was.
Some evoke the revels and the
<i>grisettes</i> depicted in Louis Huart&#8217;s
<i>Physiologie de l&#8217;Etudiant</i>, Musset&#8217;s
<i>Mimi Pinson</i>, and M&uuml;rger&#8217;s <i>La Vie
de Boh&egrave;me</i>, and others the rebellious
souls of the student martyrs of 1789,
1830, 1848, and 1871.</p>

<p>According to the former, the contemporary
student is a morose, prudent,
selfish, woman-hating, digging
prig, with no higher dreams than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
pettifogging politics and bourgeois comfort, and the <i>&eacute;tudiante</i> a
scheming, avaricious adventuress. According to the latter, he is
snobbish, extravagant, and dissipated, a brainless spendthrift,
gambler, debauchee, and drunkard, and his amorette, aside from
differences of sex, his perfect counterpart.</p>

<p>There is truth in these somewhat conflicting charges, since both
these types of student do exist. The curious thing is that similar
complaints have been made by the alumni out in the world for
almost as long as there have been alumni. It is not easy to go
back far enough into the history of the <i>Quartier Latin</i> to escape
caustic aspersions on its ignoble present and fond reversions to
its fine and proper past.</p>

<p>If there is one period that is vaunted to-day above another as
the golden age of the Latin Quarter, it is the period portrayed
in the writings of M&uuml;rger, De Musset, and Nestor Roqueplan,&mdash;period
when &#8220;<i>le vin &eacute;tait spirituel et la folie philosophique</i>&#8221;; period
of innumerable drolleries and of two revolutions; and yet each
of these three writers, even the happy-hearted M&uuml;rger, had recourse
to that necessary, if puerile, vanishing point of the perspective
of thought,&mdash;an anterior golden age.</p>

<p>A person who did not know their authorship would take the
opening chapters of De Musset&#8217;s <i>Confession d&#8217;un Enfant du
Si&egrave;cle</i> to have been written in this year of grace 1904 by a disgruntled
university alumnus, who was casting longing, lingering
looks behind him to De Musset&#8217;s time. As, for instance, this
passage: &#8220;The ways of the students and the artists&mdash;ways so
fresh, so beautiful, so full of buoyant youthfulness&mdash;felt the effects
of the universal change. Men, in separating from women,
had muttered a word which wounds unto death,&mdash;disdain. They
plunged into wine, and ran after courtesans. The students
and the artists did likewise. They treated love as they treated
glory and religion: it was a hoary illusion. They haunted low
places. The <i>grisette</i> so imaginative, so <i>romanesque</i>, so sweet
and tender in love, found herself left behind her counter. She
was poor, and she was no more lovable; she must have hats and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
gowns; she sold herself. O shame! The young man who should
have loved her, whom she would have loved, he who formerly
escorted her to the forests of Verri&egrave;res and Romainville, to the
dances on the greensward, to the suppers in the shady coverts,
he who came to chat by the lamp in the back shop during the long
winter evenings, he who shared the morsel of bread steeped in
the sweat of her brow and her poor but sublime love,&mdash;he, this
very man who had deserted her, found her, during some night
of orgy, within the <i>lupanar</i>, pale and livid, utterly lost, with hunger
on her lips and prostitution in her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sight-seeing visitor to the highways of the <i>Quartier</i> is apt to
feel that the grumbling of the elders is well grounded. The conventional,
imperturbable, faultlessly attired <i>fils &agrave; papa</i>, and the
over-dressed, over-breezy, blondined young (?) women he observes
on the caf&eacute; terraces and in the public places, seem to have
little or nothing in common with the students and <i>grisettes</i> of
poetry and romance he is out for to see.</p>

<p>The <i>Quartier Latin</i> has changed along with the rest of the
world, of course, in the last thirty eventful years. The humiliating
memory of the Franco-Prussian war and the failure of the
Third Republic to fulfil its promises of social equality and freedom
have necessarily rendered the student somewhat more reflective;
the analytic fearlessness of science has made him more
relentlessly introspective; the growing fierceness of the struggle
for existence occasioned by the overcrowding of the professions
and the obligatory military service has forced him, in his own
despite, to be somewhat more practical; the phenomenal expansion
of industry, commerce, and finance, and their disillusionising tendencies,
have not, in the nature of things, left him entirely untainted;
and the equally phenomenal spread of luxury has instilled
some absurd and deplorable sybaritic notions into his head.</p>

<p>There has been a net loss in the <i>Quartier</i>&mdash;and where has there
not been?&mdash;in picturesqueness and spontaneity. But the vapouring
cads and the stolid &#8220;digs&#8221; who call down the wrath of the
elders are not representative: they are at the extremes of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
student body. Taken all in all, the student has changed less than
the big world about him, not only during the last thirty years,
but even during the centuries which have elapsed since he came
to his class with a bundle of straw under his arm for a seat and
his professor lectured <i>sub Jove</i>, liable to the interruptions of passing
washerwomen and street porters.</p>

<p>He has changed less; and such changes as he has undergone
are, for the most part, superficial. His love of laughter, his love
of liberty, and his love of love have not been lost. They manifest
themselves a little differently, that is all.</p>

<p>His love of liberty is not, for the moment, manifested, as it was
in the beginning, when Ruteb&oelig;uf and Villon played the highwayman
and Cl&eacute;ment Marot was king of the Bassoche, by forcing
the doors of the bourgeois and beating the watch; nor, as it
was in 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871, by mounting the barricade,
though there is never a certainty that he will not mount a barricade
to-morrow. His love of laughter does not often lead him to
the pillaging of taverns and workshops nowadays, as it did the
roistering blade of the time of Louis XI., nor to the metamorphosing
of himself into a juggler, tumbler, clown, or mountebank.
And his love of love rarely blossoms into such dainty idyls as are
recounted of the period of the Restoration and Louis Philippe.
Perhaps, if the truth were known, it was rarely they so blossomed
even then.</p>

<p>The ragged doublets, begging wallets, and pallets of straw
have gone forever, as have the street classes exposed to the inclemency
of the weather, of which they were the fitting accompaniment.
The stiff, ugly fashions of this superlatively ugly age&mdash;the cut-away
and frock coats, the &#8220;plug&#8221; and Derby hats, and the close-cropped
hair&mdash;have, in a measure, replaced the felts <i>&agrave; la</i> Rubens and flowing
ties and the wavy locks, velvet jackets, and blouses and tasselled
Basque <i>b&eacute;rets</i> of Romanticism. Among the <i>&eacute;tudiantes</i> the simple
muslin caps and chintz, muslin, and gingham frocks have fled
alarmed before modish hats and tailor-made gowns. The <i>cancan</i>,
a pitiably tame <i>cancan</i>, is danced&mdash;in public&mdash;only to satisfy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the curiosity of sensation-seeking tourists. But, allowing for
differences of customs and costumes, for the unavoidable concessions
to the more insistent claims of the spirit of the age, the
<i>Quartier Latin</i> is still the same old <i>Quartier</i>.</p>

<p>There are numbers who still &#8220;live by the grace of God, eat
when they can,&#8221; not when they would, and &#8220;sell their books
to the old book dealer for a meal or an evening at the cabaret.&#8221;
Poverty still stalks through the <i>Pays Latin</i>, and is still bravely
cuffed or blithely bluffed out of countenance there. The student
demand for rooms ranging from fifteen to thirty francs a month,
and the lively, almost fierce student patronage of the <i>cr&egrave;meries</i>,
<i>bouillons</i>, and little wine-shops (where an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> expenditure of
18 sous verges on extravagance), and of the <i>prix fixe</i> restaurants
at 22 and 25 sous, are eloquent of a wide-spread scarcity of funds.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Flicoteaux exists, and will exist,&#8221; wrote Balzac in <i>Illusions
Perdues</i>, &#8220;as long as the student shall wish to live. He eats there,&mdash;nothing
more, nothing less; but he eats there, as he works, with
a sombre or joyous activity, according to his circumstances and
his character.&#8221;</p>

<p>One cannot have lived in the <i>Quartier</i> long and not have had
student friends who had more than a passing acquaintance with
hunger and for whom a fire in winter was a festival event. In
his mansard, where the student is doomed to freeze in winter
and broil in summer, or in his stuffy, windowless <i>cabinet</i>, where
he is doomed to suffocate the year round, are enough outward
signs of destitution to rive the heart of the most hardened professional
charity visitor; and yet, ten to one, this poor devil of a
&#8220;Jack&#8221; has his &#8220;Jill,&#8221; for the <i>grisette</i> exists.</p>

<p>Yes, countless Jeremiads to the contrary notwithstanding,
the <i>grisette</i> exists; under another name or, rather, under several
other names,&mdash;there are words that defy strict definition;
but she exists; changed somewhat, as the student himself is
changed somewhat, but unchanged, as he is unchanged, in her
love of laughter, her love of liberty, and her love of love. Gracious,
graceful, and tender as ever; ignorant and clever, superstitious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and sagacious, selfish and self-sacrificing, garrulous and
reticent, cruel and kind-hearted, outspoken and deceitful, conscientious
and unscrupulous, generous and avaricious, and so
forth <i>ad infinitum</i>; inconsequent, inconsistent, capricious, contradictory,
bewitching bundle of opposites; best of comrades and
sincerest, because ficklest, of mistresses; adorable, ever-changing,
and unchangeable <i>grisette</i>!</p>

<p>Greedy of dress, the dance, and the theatre, she will sacrifice
them all at the beck of a real affection. Indifferent to fortune
when it comes her way, she will go without eating to have her
fortune told her. She will ruin a nabob without a twinge, and
share her last crust with the poor. She is true to nothing but
her latest impulse. She fears nothing but being bored.</p>

<p>Jack nibbles scant bread and cheese, goes without wine and
a fire, pawns his overcoat, his watch, and his best hat to provide
Jill with a silk petticoat or a new hat. Jill refuses a carriage and
pair for love of Jack, and makes merry, coquettish shift, for his
sake, with &#8220;a ribbon and a rag&#8221;; and she will be as ready to go
with him to the barricade to-morrow (for she dearly loves a scrimmage)
as she is to go with him to a banquet or a ball to-night.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jack (this latter-day Ab&eacute;lard) and almost as much
to Jill (this latter-day H&eacute;lo&iuml;se), to their unaffected sentimentalities
and innocent deviltries, the <i>Quartier</i> has a luminous atmosphere
of gayety and poesy, is, in a word, an adequate emblem
of &#8220;the folly of youth that amuses itself breaking window-panes,
and which is, nevertheless, priceless beside the wisdom of age
that mends them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note the student&#8217;s street masking, dancing, and singing, and
his manifold extravagances at the time of the Carnival, the <i>Mi-car&ecirc;me</i>,
and the <i>Quatorze Juillet</i>, and on special outdoor festival
occasions of his own. Watch his pranks and listen to his magpie
chatter in his restaurants, caf&eacute;s, and <i>brasseries</i>,&mdash;not the big,
gaudy establishments of the &#8220;<i>Boul&#8217; Mich</i>,&#8221; where he apes the
<i>chic</i> of the bourgeois with whose purse he comes into direct and,
for him, disastrous competition, and where, for the matter of that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
the bourgeois often outnumbers him; but in the dingy resorts of
the back and side streets, where he is quite his harum-scarum
self, where he is free to shout, sing, caper, and guy to his heart&#8217;s
content, play combs and tin horns, and applaud with beer-mugs
and canes, use floors for chairs, chairs for hobby-horses, tables
for floors and chairs, and sandwiches for missiles, and dance
his Mariette upon his shoulder or dandle her upon his knee;
and where he can vary the monotony of his dominoes and <i>manille</i>
by throwing a somersault or executing a pigeon-wing or by a turn
at <i>savate</i>, leap-frog, or puss-in-the-corner. Follow him into the
meetings of his bizarre clubs and sodalities; to the spots where he
dances for the love of dancing,&mdash;<i>not</i> the <i>Bullier</i>, where, except
for rare occasions, he merely forms part of a show; to his
midnight suppers and masquerades,&mdash;<i>Bal des Internes</i>, <i>Bal des
Quat&#8217;z&#8217; Arts</i>, <i>Bal Julien</i>, and others quite as characteristic because
less renowned: in all these places and situations he displays a
faculty for impromptu larking, for fabricating jocund pandemoniums
at short notice, that prove him no degenerate son of his father
and no mean perpetuator of the mirthful prowess of his grandsires
and great-grandsires.</p>

<p>Go with him and his Finette, his Blanchette, his Rosette, his
Louisette, or his Juliette, for a Sunday picnic at Bois-Meudon or
Joinville-le-Pont, and share with them&mdash;if your wind is sufficient
and your Anglo-Saxon dignity can bear it&mdash;their more than infantile
or lamb-like gambols over the meadows and under the
trees. Keep with him, if you can be so privileged, his or her
Saint&#8217;s Day. Celebrate with him the <i>F&ecirc;te des Rois</i>, the <i>Jour de
l&#8217;An</i>, and the <i>R&eacute;veillon</i>. Rejoice with him at the successful passing
of his &#8220;exams&#8221; or condole with him for being plucked. Help
him empty the pannier and the cask received from home. Enter
into the spirit of his yarns, toasts, <i>gaudrioles</i>, and <i>chansons</i> on
these occasions; into the spirit of his betrayal of sentiment and
play of wit, of his gallantry and persiflage, his repartee and poetry,
his exaggerations and fantasies; of his <i>pas-seuls</i> and <i>pas-&agrave;-quatres</i>,
his revivals of <i>cancan</i> (not the tame variety), <i>bourr&eacute;e</i>, and <i>chahut</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
his imitations of fandangos and jigs, his ceremonious travesties
of saraband and minuet, and his impulsive launching of <i>danses
in&eacute;dits</i>. Enjoy with him his accompaniments on glasses and symphonies
on plates, his sallies and his salads, his coffee and his antics,
his <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i> and his mummeries, his horse-play and his wine. Under
their spell you will be convinced, if you have any relish for life
in you, that for graces of fellowship, refinements of revelry, and
subtleties of tomfoolery the student of the <i>Quartier</i> has not his
peer upon the planet.</p>

<p>The memory of M&uuml;rger and the cult of merriment under misfortune
which his immortal <i>Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i> symbolises is faithfully
cherished. His anniversary is observed every summer about
the time of St. Jean by a pilgrimage to his monument in the Luxembourg
and a banquet at an average price of fifteen sous in some
indulgent cabaret or caf&eacute;. A recent menu was as follows: bread,
wine, blood pudding, fried potatoes, almond cakes, cigars for the
students and flowers for the <i>&eacute;tudiantes</i>. One year a thoughtless
board of managers committed the indiscretion of elevating the
price of the M&uuml;rger banquet to something over a franc, whereat
the whole <i>Quartier</i> was thrown into a veritable tumult of protest.</p>

<p>The real student cafes and cabarets<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>&mdash;which I would not name
nor locate for a kingdom, since their obscurity is the one thing
that saves them from being spoiled&mdash;are the lineal descendants
and, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the worthy successors of the caf&eacute;s and
cabarets of the students&#8217; fathers and grandfathers and of the
taverns of his remote forbears.</p>

<p>There the ancient custom of charcoaling or chalking the walls
with skits, epigrams, and caricatures, is kept up.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>There long-haired, unkempt poets mount on tables and counters,
glass in hand, and flaunt their new-born epics, tragedies, and ballads,
or loll in dreamful, languishing poses and intone their elegies
and idyls, as did Ruteb&oelig;uf, Villon, Gringoire, and Cyrano
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
de Bergerac in their respective epochs; Moli&egrave;re, Boileau, Racine,
and Cr&eacute;billon, in the seventeenth century, at the &#8220;<i>Mouton Blanc</i>&#8221;;
as did only yesterday M&eacute;rat, Anatole France, L&eacute;on Vallade, and
Leconte de Lisle at the <i>Caf&eacute; Voltaire</i>; De Banville, M&uuml;rger,
Daudet, and Paul Ar&egrave;ne at the <i>Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Europe</i>; Copp&eacute;e, Mend&egrave;s,
Rollinat, Mallarm&eacute;, Bourget (who began as a poet), Bouchor,
Richepin, and Villiers de l&#8217;Isle-Adam at &#8220;The Sherry Cobbler&#8221;;
and as did all the versifiers of a generation at the <i>Caf&eacute; Bobino</i>
(adjoining the famous little theatre of the same name), &#8220;which
was,&#8221; says Daudet, &#8220;the holy of holies for everybody who rhymed,
painted, and trod the boards in the <i>Quartier Latin</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>There they f&ecirc;te the victories of their respective poetic sects&mdash;<i>Roman</i>,
<i>Instrumentiste</i>, <i>Magique</i>, <i>Magnifique</i>, <i>D&eacute;liquescent</i>, <i>Incoh&eacute;rent</i>,
or <i>N&eacute;o-D&eacute;cadent</i>, as the case may be, just as the Romanticists
in their time, and the Parnassians, D&eacute;cadents, and Symbolists
in their times, f&ecirc;ted their victories at the <i>Caf&eacute; Procope</i>.
There they burn incense&mdash;as it was burned erstwhile at the <i>Soir&eacute;es</i>
and <i>Petits Soupers Procope</i> to Hugo, Baudelaire, and Verlaine&mdash;to
their divinities who have consented&mdash;oh, monstrous condescension!&mdash;to
foregather with them.</p>

<p>There, too, they blend becomingly philosophy and disputation
with good cheer, as did D&#8217;Alembert, Voltaire, Condorcet, Diderot,
and Rousseau in this same all-absorbent Procope; Corot,
G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, Fran&ccedil;ais, Jules Breton, Baudry, Harpignies, Garnier,
Falgui&egrave;re, Andr&eacute; Theuriet, and Edmond About at the <i>Caf&eacute; de
Fleurus</i>; and Th&eacute;rion, the original of the Elys&eacute;e M&eacute;rant of Daudet&#8217;s
<i>Rois en Exil</i>, Wallon, the original of Colline in M&uuml;rger&#8217;s
<i>Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>, and Barbey d&#8217;Aur&eacute;villy, as famous for his lace-embroidered
neckties and red-banded white trousers as for his
caustic wit, at the <i>Caf&eacute; Tabourey</i>.</p>

<p>The student&#8217;s lyric gift and <i>penchant</i> for good fellowship find
further vent in little cellar (<i>caveau</i>), back-room, or upper-room
<i>caf&eacute;-concerts</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> of his own founding, at which, in a congenial atmosphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
of tobacco and beer, he sings and recites to sympathetic
listeners <i>chansons</i> and monologues of his own composition, and
at which he permits the <i>&eacute;tudiante</i>, who almost invariably fancies
herself predestined to a brilliant career on the operatic stage, to
dispense, by way of interlude, the popular <i>risqu&eacute;</i> and sentimental
songs of the day.</p>

<p>The editorial staffs of the ephemeral literary journals and reviews
(<i>revues des jeunes</i> and <i>journaux litt&eacute;raires</i>) are so many
mutual admiration societies whose business meetings&mdash;there is so
little business to be done&mdash;are very apt to be banquets or <i>soir&eacute;es
litt&eacute;raires</i>. In fact, more than one sheet of the <i>Quartier</i> has no
other business office than the back room of the cabaret its editors
frequent.</p>

<p>These amateur publications (in which, for the matter of that,
nearly every one who counts in French literature has made his
d&eacute;but) are not burdened with modesty. Witness the closing paragraph
of the leading editorial of the first, last, and only number
of the <i>Royal-Boh&egrave;me</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Our aim is to demand charity of those who, having intelligence
and heart, will not see in us a band of useless beggars; our
hope, to more than repay our benefactors with the fruits of our
thoughts and the flowers of our dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a na&iuml;ve and concrete statement of the revolutionist&#8217;s pet
formula, &#8220;From every one according to his ability and to every
one according to his need,&#8221; or as an example of what would be
called, in good American, &#8220;unmitigated nerve,&#8221; the above would
be hard to match.</p>

<p>An anonymous writer has defined the Bohemian as &#8220;a person
who sees with his own eyes, hears with his own ears, thinks his
own thoughts, follows the lead of his own heart, and holds to the
realities of life wherever they conflict with its conventions.&#8221; The
typical Bohemian student of Paris is a Bohemian of this sort.
He loves his comfort as well as another fellow, but he is not ready
to sell his soul for it. Material well-being at the price of submission&mdash;moral,
social, or political&mdash;he will none of. Practical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
considerations do not count with him when they antagonise his
ideals.</p>

<p class="captionc">A LATIN QUARTER TYPE</p></div>

<p>In his monumental <i>Illusions Perdues</i>, Balzac describes at length
a Latin Quarter <i>c&eacute;nacle</i> of nine persons, of which his hero, the
poet Lucien de Rubempr&eacute;, became a member. Among other
things, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In this cold mansard the finest dreams of sentiment were
realised. Here brothers, all equally strong in different regions
of knowledge, enlightened each other in good faith, telling one
another everything, even their base thoughts,&mdash;all of an immense
instruction, and all tested in the crucible of want.&#8221; Something
of the beautiful earnestness of these ideal and idealised Bohemians
of Balzac has laid hold on the Bohemian student of to-day.
Like the members of this mansard <i>c&eacute;nacle</i>, he is seeking conscientiously
and eagerly for a comprehensive formula of life.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The student is thinking,&#8221; writes an actual student, in answer
to the charges of materialism, dilettanteism, and subserviency
brought against the student body. &#8220;His thought is fermenting,
trying its force, preparing the future. The present hour is grave,
an hour of transition. In literature, in art, in politics, something
new is desired, expected, sought after. Everywhere is chaos.
Everywhere opposing elements clash. A general synthesis or an
exclusive choice from which harmony may spring is called for.
What are the laws of this synthesis, what is the criterion of this
choice? These are the questions which, anxiously, without ceasing,
and, perhaps, in spite of himself, the contemporary youth is
asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>There have been brief seasons when the whole university world&mdash;students
and faculties alike&mdash;has been afflicted with intellectual
snobbishness, indifference, discouragement, disillusion, fatigue,
and even despair.</p>

<p>The present has its share of disillusion and discouragement,
but it is primarily a period of search. In the faculties, alongside
of those figure-heads&mdash;in which faculties always and everywhere
have been rich&mdash;who cling tenaciously to whatever is ancient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
respectable, and commonplace, are men who are looking up and
out.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> M. Lavisse, for instance, with his recurring emphasis on
the necessity of a closer union of the university with the people,
is a sort of second (and a more scientific) Michelet; and M. Lavisse
has several colleagues who are little, if any, behind him in
large suggestiveness. The thought-stirring influence of the disinterested,
investigating zeal of Pasteur (and his successors, Roux
and Duclaux) and of Berthelot is also profound. A provincial
professor, M. Herv&eacute;, has recently been disciplined for unblushing
anti-patriotism.</p>

<p>The <i>Coll&egrave;ge Libre des Sciences Sociales</i> (subsidised by the state)
and the <i>Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales</i> have flung their doors
wide open to socialism. Furthermore, this once descried doctrine
has a hold on the university itself. Just what the following
of socialism is among the students, it is not possible, in the complete
absence of reliable statistics, to determine; but it is safe to
say that it is large and fervent, since student socialists appear in
convincing force at every important socialistic demonstration.</p>

<p>At the last anniversary of the &#8220;Bloody Week&#8221; of the Commune,
in P&egrave;re-la-Chaise I chanced upon two students wearing red eglantines
in their buttonholes, with whom I had taken my meals for
several weeks previous without having been given the slightest
intimation that they were interested in social or political problems,
to say nothing of being socialists. The talk that resulted
from this chance meeting revealed to me that they were actively
affiliated with an important socialistic organisation, and that their
convictions had marched fearlessly and far. There are many such
unproclaimed and unsuspected socialists in the Quarter.</p>

<p>Anarchy also&mdash;that is, the philosophical type of anarchy so
much in favour in certain literary and artistic and even in certain
scientific groups&mdash;has an indefinite and fluctuating but extensive
student penumbra.</p>

<p>No, the student&#8217;s noble aspirations have not all forsaken him.
He abhors, as he has always abhorred, the prudish, the prudent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
the politic, the hypocritical, and the mean. He has not become
hopelessly subservient any more than he has become hopelessly
morbid or hopelessly unsentimental. He can still resent dictation,
as he can still laugh and love. If he truckles to his professors in
the matter of Greek and Latin roots, it is that Greek and Latin
roots are subjects of supreme indifference to him. When his
honest thinking and his deeper emotions are concerned, he is as
recalcitrant as ever. He recognises no authority, neither president
nor prelate, general nor judge, nothing but his own sense of
truth and right.</p>

<p>He is thinking. What is more, he is ready to accept the logical
consequences of his thinking. When the time comes that these
consequences tally with action, he will act. He has the same
imperious need to act that he has to romp and to love. He looks
to action&mdash;direct action, street action&mdash;for redress of wrong.
He cannot help it: it is his nature. Intensity is the primal law of
his being and will out, though he is merely telling a story, playing
a joke, kissing a cheek, or singing a song. He is not fifty, and
he is French. He has the Quixotism, the fine rashness, the sublime
foolhardiness, of his years and of his race.</p>

<p>With a mobility impossible for the Teuton or Anglo-Saxon
to understand, but which may be, notwithstanding, the highest
form of self-control, he passes from vigorous frolic to vigorous
work and <i>vice versa</i> instantaneously. For him it is no farther
from a laugh or a kiss to a barricade than it is from a laugh to a
kiss; and why should it be, when the laugh, the kiss, and the barricade
are (as they are with him), co-ordinate assertions of liberty?
&#8220;Frivolous as a pistol bullet,&#8221; he flashes to his mark. Given
the impact of provocation, he does not know what veering or
wabbling means.</p>

<p>Some contemporary&mdash;De Vog&uuml;&eacute;, I think&mdash;has said, &#8220;The
student always rules those who think they are ruling him,&#8221; in which
he resembles a womanly woman; &#8220;and, when the critical moment
comes, he resumes his liberty of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he has not been on a barricade in thirty years, it is because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
neither Boulangism, Dreyfusism,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> D&eacute;roul&egrave;dism, nor anti-Combeism,
though he played some part in each, won, or deserved to win,
his full allegiance. He has not taken the traditional chip off his
shoulder, however, nor given any one permission to tread on his
toes. On the contrary, he has shown flashes of his old temper,
even in the tranquil third of a century just passed, often enough
to leave no doubt of its persistence. It is only a little more than
twenty years since the <i>Quartier</i> was in an uproar by reason of a
slanderous article on the students published in the <i>Cri du Peuple</i>
the day after the death of Jules Vall&egrave;s.</p>

<p>It is only a round fifteen years since the students, taking into
their own hands the punishment of the <i>souteneurs</i> of the <i>Quartier</i>,
ducked a number of them in the frog-pond of the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>It is only ten years since the students set all Paris and all France
by the ears because the government had interfered&mdash;unwarrantably,
as they believed&mdash;with the immemorial usages of the <i>Quat&#8217;z&#8217;
Arts</i> ball. The <i>Quartier</i> was flooded with soldiers, blood was
shed, and there was one life lost. The students carried their
point. Parliament intervened, and the proceedings begun in the
courts against the organisers of the ball were dropped. What the
consequences might otherwise have been no one can tell; but it
is almost certain they would have been not local, but national.</p>

<p>It is only six or seven years since it took a strong force of police
to defend against the wrath of the students the director of the
<i>Ecole des Arts D&eacute;coratifs</i>, whose offence was nothing more heinous
than favouring the sale, under school auspices, of the drawing
materials, by dealing in which a medical student had hitherto
earned the money to pursue his studies; and this state of things
lasted several days. And only a little over two years ago the students
protested as vigorously against the condemnation of Tailhade
for his incendiary article in <i>Le Libertaire</i> as they had against
the condemnation of Richepin for his <i>Chansons des Gueux</i> a
quarter of a century before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>It was in a caf&eacute; of the Left Bank that French volunteers for
the Boer war were recruited; and it was most of all from the students,
when Kruger came to Paris, that the ministry feared the
anti-British demonstrations that might bring international complications,&mdash;demonstrations
which it craftily diverted by allowing
the student pro-Boer enthusiasm the fullest scope.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Russian students by the Russian government
aroused among the students of Paris no little sympathy,
which was given expression in indignation meetings. It was
probably quite as much the dread of the student displeasure as
of the anarchist bomb that kept the czar on his last visit to France
from entering Paris.</p>

<p>The above illustrations of the students&#8217; irritability are the proverbial
straws that show which way the wind blows, and they
might be multiplied indefinitely.</p>

<p>There is no possible doubt of the student&#8217;s growing disgust with
the corruption and hypocrisy of the present republic,&mdash;this nominal
democracy that is in reality a plutocracy,&mdash;nor of his slowly crystallising
resolution to have either something better than a republic
or a better republic; and, in the long run, he always gets
what he wants. The student strength is out of all proportion to
the student numbers. Let the students take their old place in
the streets of the <i>Quartier</i> to-morrow&mdash;5,000 or 500 strong&mdash;with
a real rallying cry, and thrills of joy and shudders of apprehension
will traverse the length and breadth of France.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE persons organically connected with the University of
Paris&mdash;the students and the professors&mdash;are only the
nucleus, the rallying-point, so to speak, of the intellectual
population of the Latin Quarter. About them, and quite as
numerous as the thousands the university at any one time enrolls,
are gathered those students in the largest sense of the word&mdash;painters,
sculptors, architects, poets, novelists, critics, journalists,
historians, philosophers, philologists, scientists, inventors, and
bibliophiles&mdash;who need the help of lectures, museums, laboratories,
and libraries in their daily tasks, or who, dependent on that indefinable
something called atmosphere for productiveness, can
hardly conceive being at their scholarly or artistic best anywhere
in the world but in this particular corner of it which has given
them their training and inspiration.</p>

<p>About the university as a centre are also grouped those alumni
who, quite independently of their callings, cling to the <i>Quartier</i> as
a cockney clings to the town for reasons gay or serious, trivial or
weighty, fantastic or rational,&mdash;attachment to a lodging, a caf&eacute;,
a club, a restaurant, to the Luxembourg Gardens or the quays
of the Seine, to book-stalls or shops of antiquities, to a chum or
a mistress,&mdash;from any of the various motives of habit, taste, sentiment,
or passion.</p>

<p>Finally, the <i>Quartier</i> retains those alumni who, cut off (whether
by the achievement of a degree or the failure to achieve one) from
the convenient parental remittances, are dismayed by the risks
of a penniless plunge into the great, unfamiliar world. In the
<i>Quartier</i>, where they are known, they can count on a modicum
of credit for a modicum of time from tailors, <i>restaurateurs</i>, and
landlords, and on the unusurious loans of a little knot of friends.
&#8220;One knows,&#8221; wrote Richepin, apropos of this matter, in his
<i>Etapes d&#8217;un R&eacute;fractaire</i>, &#8220;that at such an hour in the rue de
l&#8217;Ecole de M&eacute;decine or at the head of the rue Monsieur-le-Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
an easy-chair holds out its arms to him, a tobacco pouch opens
its heart to him, a friend lets him bellow his verses. These are
so many consolations. What do I say? They are so many resources,&mdash;sometimes
the only ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the <i>Quartier</i>, with these resources, a fellow will not starve
in one month or two, as he might elsewhere. Besides, if the
worst comes to the worst, there is the familiar and friendly Seine
near by and the sweet, clean &#8220;Doric little morgue,&#8221; where he is
bound to feel at home and where he will be speedily recognised.</p>

<p>A good proportion of these post-graduate denizens of the <i>Quarter</i>
are either by choice or by necessity Bohemians. To the former
class (<i>Boh&egrave;mes par go&ucirc;t</i>) belongs my friend B&mdash;&mdash;, whom
for conveniences&#8217; sake we will call Berteil,&mdash;Gustave Berteil.</p>

<p>In a dingy h&ocirc;tel of the rue Racine, just off the <i>Quartier&#8217;s</i> highway,
the Boulevard St. Michel, in a room which costs perhaps
forty francs a month, perhaps forty-five, and which has nothing
about it to distinguish it from the room of a student who arrived
in Paris yesterday, except for a shelf of original and other editions
of the elder French dramatists, M. Berteil (Gustave Berteil,
simple Gustave to his friends), bachelor, aged forty-three,
has lived continuously ever since his salad days.</p>

<p>Twenty-three years ago Gustave came up to Paris from a Proven&ccedil;al
town, where his father was a wealthy notary, to prepare
himself, in pursuance of the paternal desire, for admission to the
bar. He was equipped with so much knowledge of life as the
average provincial youth has at twenty, so much book knowledge
as the average provincial <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> affords, a close acquaintance with
the old French drama, for which the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> would have shuddered
to be held accountable, and a consuming desire to write for the
contemporary stage.</p>

<p>During as many years as are ordinarily required for taking a degree
in law, Gustave devoted the pleasant days to foraging for
old dramatists in the book-stalls and along the quays, the rainy
days to play-writing and to perusing, repairing, and fondling his
yellowed, tattered, worm-eaten acquisitions in his room,&mdash;where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
he had his meals served him,&mdash;and his evenings (whatever the
weather) to the auditoriums or stage entrances of the theatres
and to the caf&eacute;s where the <i>cabotins</i> (actors) most do congregate.</p>

<p>His relations to the law were limited, so far as is known, to the
<i>bona fide</i> purchase of expensive legal text books, which he invariably
bartered, after a decent interval, for editions of his favourites,&mdash;a
device, less ingenious than ingenuous, for at once quieting
his conscience and obtaining larger remittances from home.</p>

<p>When the time came for Gustave (supposed young advocate) to
return to the C&ocirc;te d&#8217;Azur and there assist his father in handling
testaments and deeds, he made a clean breast of it by post.</p>

<p>Thereupon the father cut off the son&#8217;s allowance, thinking
thus &#8220;to starve the rascal,&#8221; as he bluntly expressed it, &#8220;into submission.&#8221;
He very nearly succeeded in the starving part of his
programme, as he discovered to his genuine horror,&mdash;for he was
at bottom not a bad papa,&mdash;when, at the end of an anxious year
without tidings from the boy, he came to Paris and found his novel
prodigal out at heels and elbows, hollowed in at stomach, and
rickety at the knees; with absolutely nothing quite intact in
fact about his person or surroundings&mdash;except the shelf of old
dramatists, which would easily have procured him food and fuel.
Berteil <i>p&egrave;re</i> was mollified, if sadly disillusionised, by this ocular
demonstration of pluck on the part of Berteil <i>fils</i>. He settled on
his unnatural offspring an allowance of 2,500 francs a year, to be
trebled whenever he should abandon Bohemia for legitimate
business, and left him to live his own life in his own way.</p>

<p>This way has not turned out to be greatly different from
the way of Gustave&#8217;s nominal student days, and for at least ten
years it has not varied from one year to another by the value of
a hair.</p>

<p>Every morning at ten, winter and summer, the h&ocirc;tel gar&ccedil;on
enters M. Berteil&#8217;s room, without rapping, to bring him his coffee
and to inform him of the weather. If the gar&ccedil;on reports that it
is really pleasant,&mdash;and the gar&ccedil;on knows from long experience,
you may be sure, what M. Berteil considers really pleasant,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>&mdash;M. Berteil spends the day book-hunting on the quays, where every
<i>bouquineur</i> and <i>bouquiniste</i> greets him cordially as an old acquaintance.
If the gar&ccedil;on&#8217;s weather bulletin is unfavourable, he orders
his <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> and dinner sent up to his room, and spends the day in
the society of his old dramatists and such of his friends, whose
name is legion, as may chance to call. He still haunts, evenings,
as he did in the beginning, the caf&eacute;s affected by the <i>cabotins</i>, with
whom he passes for the most brilliant conversationalist on theatrical
matters in or out of the &#8220;profession.&#8221; But he abjured long
ago theatre auditoriums and stage entrances, the latter because he
can now meet histrionic celebrities on an equal footing, the former
because he holds modern plays trash and modern methods of
interpreting old plays tinsel. He also put away long ago his
youthful, disquieting ambition to write for the contemporary
stage, because he despaired of matching the old dramatists in
their manner and disdained the manner of the new.</p>

<p>When he receives his monthly remittance of fr. 208.35, he gives
the odd centimes to the first street beggar he meets,&mdash;for luck,&mdash;and
consecrates fifty francs at once to a dinner with one or two of
his intimates and the <i>amie</i> of his law-student (?) days, who, still
fair, though &#8220;fat and forty,&#8221; is the prosperous proprietress of a
little stationery shop in his street. The balance of the remittance
amply suffices him to live thirty days more in his modest fashion
and to add a new specimen or two to his collection of books.</p>

<p>I do not know of a person whose life is organised more rationally,&mdash;I
would say scientically if Gustave did not abhor the word
science and all its derivatives; and, in the teeth of the adage which
warns us to call no man happy till he dies, I do not hesitate to
say that Gustave Berteil is happy, and has been happy from the
day of his reconciliation with his sire. Indeed, if I were asked
to name the happiest man of my acquaintance, I should answer,
&#8220;Gustave Berteil,&#8221; without a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>Gustave, like the majority of the Bohemians from choice,
was a Bohemian by necessity for a time; but the <i>Quartier</i> has
always had a sprinkling of brilliant, forceful personalities who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
have taken Bohemian vows without ever having had to consider
the bread-and-butter question.</p>

<p>Such was the deceased artist Henri Pille (associated in his latter
days with Montmartre), whose appearance implied utter poverty,
but who is said to have had landed property in a southern province
which made the fluctuations of the picture market a matter of
little concern to him.</p>

<p>Such is, or, perhaps, was, the poet Maurice Bouchor, to whom
Richepin dedicated his virile volume, <i>Les Blasph&egrave;mes</i>. Bouchor,
who now devotes almost all his time and energy to the elevation
of the working people through reading clubs and the <i>Universit&eacute;s
Populaires</i>, is regarded by many of his old associates as a renegade
from Bohemia. He is confessedly a renegade from many
of its livelier and noisier pleasures, as his age and his gentle nature
entitle him to be. But he still lives less pretentiously than his
means permit, is still &#8220;thinking his own thoughts, following the
leadings of his own heart, and holding to the realities of life where-ever
they conflict with its conventions,&#8221; and so has not entirely
forfeited his claim, it is to be hoped, to be ranked with the Bohemians
of the Quarter.</p>

<p>Such also is Jean Richepin, in spite of his sumptuous establishment
on the Right Bank, a sort of Parisian Menelik, whose
barbaric costumes and audacious exploits have entered as completely
into the legendary lore of the Quarter as the explosive inconsistencies
of Jules Vall&egrave;s and the alternate aspirings and back-slidings
of Paul Verlaine. In the early eighties, when he paraded
the fantastic title of <i>Roi des Truands</i> (King of the Vagrants),
Richepin wore a talismanic bracelet and a curiously-shaped hat,
as badges of his rank. &#8220;There was even,&#8221; says his fellow-Bohemian,
Emile Goudeau, &#8220;an epic struggle between Jean Richepin
and the poor but great caricaturist Andr&eacute; Gill [a Bohemian by
necessity] as to which of the two would root out of the hatteries
of Paris the most bizarre head-dress. Now Gill and now Richepin
had the advantage. The illustrious Sapeck was the judge of
last resort, and awarded the palm to the victor.&#8221; It would take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
a long chapter to describe the costumes which have played a part
in Richepin&#8217;s numerous and strange avatars. At one time, if the
narrative of a friend can be trusted, he remained in hiding for
almost a fortnight because his wardrobe was reduced to a simple

window curtain; and his
adventures have been so
extraordinary that this ludicrous
incident, improbable
as it sounds, does
not defy belief.</p>

<p>Richepin, Bouchor,
and Paul Bourget, returning
from &#8220;The
Sherry Cobbler&#8221; one
night, halted under the
arcade of the <i>Od&eacute;on</i>,
named themselves <i>Les
Vivants</i>, and solemnly
pledged each other eternal
aid and fidelity. This
was the period when
Bourget&#8217;s ambition was
poetry, when he wore
pantaloons of water
green, and imitated the
miraculous cravats of Barbey d&#8217;Aur&eacute;villy and the mode of living
of Balzac. &#8220;Bourget submitted himself,&#8221; says Goudeau, &#8220;to
a ferocious Balzacian r&eacute;gime. He dined very early, went to bed
immediately after, and had himself called on the stroke of 3
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>.... The poet-recluse then drank two or three bowls of
black coffee, like Balzac, and, like Balzac, worked until seven.
Then he slept again for an hour, rose, for good this time, and
applied himself to the bread-winning activities which poverty imposes
on young litt&eacute;rateurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bourget, who began thus as a Bohemian from necessity, has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
ended as a snob. He is a fair sample of the &#8220;<i>arriv&eacute;</i>&#8221; who disavows
his past, and</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I shall be adjudged severe, perhaps,&#8221; says the poet and socialist
deputy Clovis Hugues; &#8220;but I am of those who think that the
sacrifice of the <i>chevelure</i> [long hair] is the most dangerous of concessions
to the modern <i>bourgeoisie</i>.... In literature there is an
affinity between the sudden disappearance of the familiar mane
and the forsaking of the good comrades of the days of want. The
transformation effected, one may still have much <i>esprit</i>, but one
has ceased to be a good fellow. Beware, then, of the tribunes
and the poets who establish relations with the <i>gar&ccedil;ons coiffeurs!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not know that Bourget ever had any &#8220;<i>chevelure</i>&#8221; to
leave in the hands of the Delilah of bourgeois respectability, but
it would seem that he had sacrificed on the altar of his parvenu-ship
the sincere soulfulness of which the &#8220;<i>chevelure</i>&#8221; as well as another
thing may be the visible symbol, since he apparently has no sympathy
or helping hand for his younger painter brother who is
bravely struggling up to recognition against heavy odds.</p>

<p>Even the conceited &#8220;<i>arriv&eacute;s</i>&#8221; of literature and the arts are entitled
to a certain respect, especially when they have &#8220;arrived,&#8221;
as has Bourget, by force of genuine talent and persistent work.
However ridiculous the pretentious airs they assume, they are
not cravens. They have left Bohemia, but they have left it with
colours flying, with all the honours of war. As much cannot be
said for the recreants,&mdash;called the &#8220;<i>soumis</i>&#8221; or, still more expressively,
the &#8220;<i>moutons</i>,&#8221;&mdash;who have forsaken Bohemia, without the
excuse of having &#8220;arrived,&#8221; from sheer pusillanimity, because they
found its paths of hardship, struggle, and sacrifice too rugged in
comparison with the easy highways of bourgeoisdom. Towards
these one&#8217;s dominating sentiment can hardly be other than pity or
contempt,&mdash;contempt, if they take greedily to the flesh-pots without
regret at selling their souls to Mammon; pity, if they do regret.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>Richepin, who knows this Bohemian world so well, has characterised
the two varieties of &#8220;<i>moutons</i>.&#8221; Of the first (the unconscious
&#8220;<i>moutons</i>,&#8221; so to speak) he says, &#8220;Having returned to the
paternal roast, married their little cousins, and established themselves
notaries in towns of thirty thousand inhabitants, they have
the self-satisfaction of rehearsing before the fire their poor-artist
adventures with the magniloquence of a traveller who describes
a tiger hunt&#8221;; and of the others (the conscious &#8220;<i>moutons</i>&#8221;),
&#8220;Wretchedly sad in the existence into which they have entered
against their wishes, in the intellectual tombs to which they have
consigned themselves, they slowly atrophy. The banal is particularly
terrible in this,&mdash;that, if one returns to it after having
been disgusted with it, it is to find it more <i>banal</i> still, and to die
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few of the Bohemians who have been intimately associated
with the Quarter during the last twenty-five or thirty years have
been able to make shift with their literature or their art alone.
In order to keep body and soul together, most have been constrained
to resort to compromises which are humiliating and disillusionising,
but which are not necessarily demoralising, and which
stop a long way this side of absolute surrender. Mallarm&eacute;
taught English in the <i>lyc&eacute;es</i> nearly all his life, and conducted
alone, during a short period, a journal entitled <i>La Derni&egrave;re Mode</i>.
Verlaine was long an employee of the <i>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</i>, had periods
of teaching, and even tried his hand at farming. Edmond Haraucourt,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
Camille St. Croix, L&eacute;on Dierx, Emile Goudeau, Canqueteau,
and Trimouillat have been at one time or another petty
functionaries. Nearly all have dabbled in journalism. The
happiest compromise, however, the most independent form of
dependence, so to say, has been hit upon by Jacques Le Lorrain,
poet and author of <i>L&#8217;Au Del&agrave;</i>, who set up as a cobbler in 1896
in the rue du Sommerard, close by the Cluny Museum.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>It is no infrequent thing for the loyal Bohemian to &#8220;arrive&#8221; too
late to profit by his success because his spirit has been imbittered
or his constitution ruined by the hardships he has undergone.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The maimed heart, the heart poniarded in this mute struggle
for life,&#8221; says Jules Vall&egrave;s in his <i>R&eacute;fractaires</i>, &#8220;cannot be taken
out of the chest and replaced by another. There are no wooden
hearts in the market. It remains there, bleeding, the poniard
at its centre. Rich one day, famous, perhaps, these victims of
obscure combats may perfume their sores if they will, sponge up
the blood, wipe away their tears; memory will tear open the wounds,
strip off the bandages. A word, a song,&mdash;joyous or sad,&mdash;will
be enough to raise in these sick souls the phantom of the past.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">F</span>IFTY odd years ago, in a volume of short stories,&mdash;little
read in France nowadays, and quite unknown, I fancy,
elsewhere,&mdash;<i>Le Roman de Toutes les Femmes</i>, Henry M&uuml;rger,
author of the universally known and loved <i>La Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>,
narrated, under the title &#8220;<i>La Biographie d&#8217;un Inconnu</i>,&#8221; the life
history of a young sculptor who died of &#8220;the malady to which
science does not dare to give its true name, <i>la mis&egrave;re</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joseph D&mdash;&mdash;, born in a provincial town of poor, hard-working,
respectable parents, manifested a strong vocation for sculpture
from his early boyhood. His father having decided to put him to
the carpenter&#8217;s trade, Joseph, who had no notion of becoming a
mechanic, went secretly to the Free School of Design. The professor
of the school procured him a place as pupil with a government
architect, which his father, under the impression that carpentry
and architecture were very much the same thing, allowed him to
accept. Joseph made such progress that he paid his way at the
end of a month, and at the end of six months earned his seven
or eight francs a day. But he was getting no nearer to sculpture
by this work; and he left the architect&#8217;s office, in the face of his
father&#8217;s opposition, and entered a sculptor&#8217;s atelier for study,
paying a month in advance for his teaching. He took part in a
competition for admission to the <i>Beaux-Arts</i>, and failed. Having
no money with which to pay for lessons, he was forced to
leave the atelier, but was received&mdash;about the only bit of good
luck in his whole career&mdash;by the great master, Rude. He lodged
at this time in the rue du Cherche-Midi, over a cow stable, where
he was warmed only by what heat ascended through a hole in the
floor.</p>

<p>Finding he could not pay for the models and materials necessary
to enter the <i>Salon</i> competitions, he assisted for a year,
without entirely neglecting his studies, a noted ornament-worker,
and put by enough to enable him to pursue his art studies to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
good advantage. Working by night in a cold workshop, he contracted
a sickness which confined him to his bed for a time, and
which swept away all his savings. As soon as he was well
again, he went back to work for his first employer (the architect),
designing ornaments whose execution was intrusted to
others. He thus gained a little pile&mdash;about 1,200 francs&mdash;with
which to compete for the <i>Salon</i>. It was stolen by a roof-worker
who, while repairing an adjacent building, had seen him counting
it.</p>

<p>This &#8220;mischance&#8221;&mdash;to go on in M&uuml;rger&#8217;s own language&mdash;&#8220;was
a terrible blow to Joseph. &#8216;There are some people who have no
luck,&#8217; he said, &#8216;who would lose with all the trumps of the pack
in their hands.&#8217; &#8216;Never mind,&#8217; he resumed, brightening, &#8216;I
will attempt the assault of the Louvre<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> with what little I have
left. I will enter there with plaster instead of bronze or
marble.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>All his courage had returned. He tried making fanciful statuettes,
which he could prepare without the expense of hiring
models; but he had little success in selling them.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>La Mis&egrave;re</i> returned, and knocked at his door. She entered,
terrible and pitiless, like a vanquished foe whose turn has come
to triumph, and who uses without mercy the right of reprisal.
Joseph&#8217;s destitution reached such a point that, when one of his
friends invited him to dinner, he answered na&iuml;vely, &#8216;I&#8217;m afraid
it will put me out: it&#8217;s not my day.&#8217; For tobacco he smoked
walnut leaves, which he gathered in the forest of Verri&egrave;res, then
dried, and chopped up fine.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;His sole hope was the coming <i>Salon</i>. In a room without
a fire,&#8221;&mdash;the odorous days of the calorific cow stable must have
seemed a paradise in retrospect,&mdash;&#8220;in a Siberian temperature,
he worked during three consecutive months on a Saint Antoine,
for he had been forced to renounce his group of Galatea, the too
costly execution of which he had deferred to better times. Clay,
in spite of its moderate cost, was too dear for his empty purse, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
same purse which had held almost a fortune; for, by a strange
irony, the thief who had taken his money had left him his purse.
He dug his clay himself, therefore, in some fields of the <i>banlieue</i>.
A rag-picker of the rue Mouffetard whom he had met, I know
not where, gave him sittings at five sous an hour; and three-quarters
of the time the worthy man invented angelic ruses to
avoid being paid.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The date set for sending to the <i>Salon</i> was near. It was time
to think of taking the plaster cast of the statue. Michelli, Fontaine,
and the other moulders who worked for the artists, when
they saw Joseph&#8217;s destitution, were unwilling to venture credit.
All he could obtain from one of them was the furnishing of the
necessary plaster. Aided by several friends, Joseph took the
cast of his statue himself. The operation lasted two days, and
turned out well.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It was the eve of the day on which the jury was to begin its
sittings and on which the works to be passed upon must be at
the Louvre, by midnight at the very latest. During the night
it came on cold, and Joseph, to minimise the action of the frost
upon his statue, the still damp plaster of which had not acquired
the solidity which dryness gives, wrapped his only blanket about
it, and piled up on it, as a cuirass of warmth against the darts of
the cold, all his clothing, playing thus, towards Saint Antoine, the
r&ocirc;le of Saint Martin.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The next forenoon two or three friends came to aid Joseph
in transporting his statue to the Louvre. The wagon arrived
four hours too late. Nor was this all. At this point, fatality
intervened in the person of an absurd <i>conci&egrave;rge</i>, who declared that
he would let nothing leave Joseph&#8217;s room before the back rent
was paid. The artists explained to the <i>conci&egrave;rge</i> that a statue
was not a piece of furniture, and that the law did not permit him
to hold it back. He would not listen to reason, and, stony in his
stubbornness, demanded a written permit from the landlord.
They hurried to Passy, where the landlord lived, and did not
find him. He would not be in before dinner. They returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
at the dinner hour. He had just gone out. It was already eight
o&#8217;clock in the evening. They decided to apply to a justice of
the peace. The justice turned them over to the commissary of
police, who began by sustaining the <i>conci&egrave;rge</i>, but who decided,
on Joseph&#8217;s representations of the injury that would be done him
if he were made to miss the <i>Salon</i>, to authorise the removal of the
statue. It was then eleven o&#8217;clock. They had barely an hour
to get to the Louvre. A dangerous coating of thin ice rendered
the streets impracticable. Vehicles could only advance at a walk.
The artists needed three hours at least, and they had only one.
Furthermore, repairs which were being made on the sewers forced
them to take the longest route. In crossing the Pont-Neuf,
Joseph and his friends heard it strike the half-hour.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s half-past eleven,&#8217; said Joseph, who was sweating great
drops in spite of the fact that the thermometer marked a north-pole
temperature.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s half-past twelve,&#8217; volunteered a young man who detached
himself from a band of painters who were returning with their
pictures because they had arrived at the Louvre too late. They
were making the best of it, and were singing gaily, &#8216;<i>Allons-nous-en,
gens de la noce! etc.</i>&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Joseph and his friends retraced their steps.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A little later Joseph exposed his Saint Antoine and a statuette
of Marguerite at the <i>Exposition du Bazar Bonne Nouvelle</i> (corresponding
to the modern <i>Salon des R&eacute;fus&eacute;s</i>), and sold the two
to the Museum of Compi&egrave;gne for 150 francs.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This paltry sum enabled him to drag himself about some time,&mdash;a
year almost. Then he entered the hospital through the intervention
of an interne, for he had no characterised malady. He
died there of exhaustion at the end of three months....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Joseph D&mdash;&mdash; died at the age of twenty-three, without rancour
or recrimination against the art that had killed him, as a brave
soldier falls on the field of battle, saluting his flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>If I have reproduced here with much fulness this old story of
M&uuml;rger&#8217;s, it is because Joseph D&mdash;&mdash; stands to the Bohemians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of the <i>Quartier</i> as a kind of saint, <i>Saint Joseph de la D&egrave;che</i>,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
patron of poor artists, and because the half-century during which
civilisation is supposed to have been advancing with enormous
strides has made no appreciable difference in the hardships of the
needy artist or in the bravery with which he faces them. Parents
are still too often dull-witted, narrow, and unsympathetic where
their offspring are concerned. Rents are still hard to pay, and art
materials and models, food, clothes, and fuel hard to be had just
when they are most needed. Luck is as capricious, the <i>conci&egrave;rge</i> as
officious, winter as brutal, warmth as coy, and death as chary of
reprieves as ever. Joseph D&mdash;&mdash; is as strictly up to date as if he
had been born in 1881 and died in 1904. One hesitates to depict
the slow starvation of one&#8217;s acquaintances and friends, even under
assumed names; and the fateful career of M&uuml;rger&#8217;s Joseph is so
perfectly typical of the careers of the poor devils of artists in the
<i>Quartier</i> of the present period that there is no necessity of depicting
it.</p>

<p>Quite as terrible, though far less romantic than the <i>mis&egrave;re</i> of
the Bohemian artist and litt&eacute;rateur, is the &#8220;<i>mis&egrave;re en habit noir</i>&#8221;&mdash;the
nomenclature is Balzac&#8217;s&mdash;of the patientless doctor, the briefless
barrister, and the unemployed or underpaid teacher and
professor.</p>

<p>Your poet, your painter, or your sculptor, is, as a rule, a careless,
jolly dog, who has something of the genuine vagabond or
adventurer in him. He cannot tolerate anything that is cut and
dried, not even prosperity; and he would be infinitely bored by
life if its elements of uncertainty were quite eliminated. He prefers
agreeable surprises to disagreeable surprises, of course; but
he prefers disagreeable surprises to no surprises at all.</p>

<p>Dissimulation is not an indispensable part of his artistic baggage.
He may flaunt and vaunt his poverty, swear at it or make game
of it, and be none the less considered, at least in his <i>milieu</i>. He
is excused from playing the dismal farce of keeping up appearances.
He may live in an attic, clothe himself in tattered and seedy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
raiment, shirk the bath-tub, ignore the very existence of the
laundress and the barber, be noisy and reckless, and defy all the
canons of the social code without stultifying himself or dishonouring
his calling. Best of all, his life is rarely a lonely one. He
suffers, but he has the <i>camaraderie</i> of suffering; and this enables
him to laugh or shout his misery away.</p>

<p>On the other hand, your so-called professional man&mdash;your
physician, for instance&mdash;must be more than decently lodged;
be arrayed, at no matter what hour of the day,&mdash;such is the Old
World convention,&mdash;in a faultless frock-coat and silk hat; be restrained,
not to say dignified, in demeanour; assume to be busy
when he is weary unto death with inaction,&mdash;and all this though
hunger be consuming his very vitals.</p>

<p>He must button his suffering securely under his respectable
black waistcoat, and wear his professional complacence when
his heart is torn with sobs. If the reputable lodging or the reputable
bearing fail him, even for a little, he is lost irrevocably.</p>

<p>Four years ago or thereabouts a young physician, one Dr.
Laporte, was arraigned before a Paris court for criminal negligence
in the practice of his profession. The court condemned
him to prison, in spite of the testimony of an eminent specialist
in his favour, but with the palliative of the <i>Loi B&eacute;renger</i>.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>The condemnation was based on these facts: Summoned to
an emergency case already compromised by lay treatment, and
not possessing the surgical instrument which it called for, Dr.
Laporte cast around for a makeshift tool. He used unsuccessfully
the only thing in any way adapted to his purpose that he
discovered in the patient&#8217;s house; and then, finding his efforts
futile, and foreseeing the fatal issue, which was not slow to arrive,
he withdrew, saying there was nothing more to be done.</p>

<p>The reasons for the attachment of clemency to the sentence were
these: the evidence showed conclusively that he had had no patients
for days and perhaps weeks; that he had no money to keep
in proper repair the instruments he owned, to say nothing of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
buying the instrument in question; and that he had not eaten a
morsel of food for a full day previous to the emergency visit,
and was a prey to the giddiness of hunger at the moment he made
his deplorable attempt.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The police investigation,&#8221; said the presiding judge to the
culprit while the trial was in progress, &#8220;shows you as nervous,
excitable, unbalanced, passing quickly from a state of exaltation
to a state of the most profound depression.&#8221; What wonder!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">A</span> RECENT morning paper contained the following item

<p class="center padt1">&#8220;<span class="smcap">La Litt&eacute;rature qui Tue.</span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Enamoured of art and persuaded that he would quickly win
a name in Paris, Louis M&mdash;&mdash;, a young man of twenty-five, left
some six months ago the little provincial city where he was born.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Like Balzac&#8217;s hero, Lucien de Rubempr&eacute;, who entered the
Latin Quarter with two hundred and forty francs in money and
the manuscripts of <i>L&#8217;Archer de Charles IX.</i> and <i>Les Marguerites</i>,
this young provincial arrived in Paris with a light purse and the
bulky manuscript of a drama in five acts, which he expected to
get performed immediately. Unfortunately, the purse was quickly
emptied, and the drama was refused by all the theatre managers.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;As his father was not rich, Louis M&mdash;&mdash; was unwilling to appeal
to him, and suffered without complaining.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;One day, however, he confessed his desperate situation to
Mme. C&mdash;&mdash;, a friend of his family, who inhabits a comfortable
apartment, rue &mdash;&mdash;. Mme. C&mdash;&mdash; promised to see what she
could do for him. In the midst of a conversation with her yesterday
he drew a revolver from his pocket, and before she could
catch his arm fired a bullet into his heart.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Death was instantaneous.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Emile Goudeau, in his <i>Dix Ans de Boh&egrave;me</i>, tells of the picturesque
suicide of a young Latin Quarter poet of his acquaintance:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;D&mdash;&mdash;, arrayed in a new suit and with his hands full of bouquets,
went up to the cashier&#8217;s desk and graciously adorned the
counter and corsage of the cashier. Then, turning to a medical
student, he said to him nonchalantly, &#8216;My dear fellow, I have
made a bet that the little point of the heart is <i>here</i> between these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
two ribs&#8217;; and he designated a spot on his vest. &#8216;Not at all,&#8217;
corrected the other, &#8216;it is lower down. <i>There!</i>&#8217; &#8216;I have lost then,&#8217;
D&mdash;&mdash; replied.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He called a cab, and ordered the <i>cocher</i> to drive him to the
Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;When the <i>cocher</i> arrived at the head of the Champs Elys&eacute;es,
and opened the cab door, there was only a corpse upon the cushions.
D&mdash;&mdash; had shot himself full in the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last season I passed on the Left Bank of the Seine, the
<i>Quartier</i> was deeply moved by the death of one of its faithful
devotees, the poet Ren&eacute; Leclerc (<i>nom-de plume</i>, Robert de la
Villoyo), who poisoned himself with cyanide of potassium.</p>

<p>Leclerc was thirty-two at the time of his death. He had inhabited
the <i>Quartier</i> for more than a decade. He had come
thither to study medicine in accordance with the wishes of his
bourgeois parents; and he had stayed on after all thought of practising
as a physician had left him, in order to pursue the literature
which had become his passion.</p>

<p>With the funds which his family provided he lived neither
too well nor too ill, working steadily, but gaining little, slowly
developing a very real, if not very robust, talent. He completed
two romances, contributed more or less regularly to <i>La Plume</i>
and the minor reviews and literary weeklies of the Left Bank,
which are the easier to enter since contributors are paid nothing
at all or very little, and placed an occasional poem and <i>chronique</i>
in the daily press. Indeed, everything went well with him up to
the moment when his family, disgruntled at his persistency in
holding to so unprofitable a calling, deprived him of his income.
Then he set out bravely to earn his living with his pen. He
besieged editors with copy, but succeeded in placing but few articles;
and, when he did place them, he was more often than not
kept waiting for his pay, and sometimes defrauded out of it altogether.
He tried in vain to find a publisher for either of his two
manuscript romances. He did difficult and ill-paid hack-work,
collaborating on a translation into French of the Norwegian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Strindberg and on an adaptation into French verse of the
<i>Mandragore</i> of Machiavelli; and he undertook&mdash;oh, the bitter
pill!&mdash;the task of writing a volume on the <i>C&ocirc;te d&#8217;Ivoire</i>, of

which he
was as ignorant
as he
was of the
borders of
the supposititious
canals
of the
planet Mars.
Even this
concession
to mercantilism&mdash;beyond
which
it is not surprising
he
was unwilling to go&mdash;did
not suffice to procure
him a living. He
ran behind two
quarters on his rent, and was threatened
with eviction. If not actually destitute,
he was on the verge of destitution.
And yet to those who were familiar with Ren&eacute; Leclerc&#8217;s
proud and sensitive spirit it seems more likely that it was
disgust with his lot rather than terror before the approach of
want which drove him to kill himself. It was because he held
his art so high that he was unwilling to survive its debasement.
He had made concessions that he regarded as enormous,&mdash;compromised
his ideal, vulgarised his taste, and prostituted (at least
so it seemed to him) his talent. It was too much. His last act-could
a dying gesture well be finer?&mdash;was to reduce to ashes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
the hateful manuscript of the <i>C&ocirc;te d&#8217;Ivoire</i> and all his other
writings that he held unworthy.</p>

<p>And journalists were found contemptible enough to censure
him, to call him coward, because he was too fastidious to
stoop to their own corrupt, degrading practices, even to save his life.</p>

<p>Among the works he left, as having his affection and which
by one of those ironies so common with the law went to his unappreciative
family (who might have saved him), was a collection
of sweet and delicate poems, entitled <i>La Guirlande de Marie</i>,
dedicated to her who had shared his prosperity and remained
the faithful friend of his adversity.</p>

<p>Here are a few stanzas (from a poem of this collection) inscribed
to Henry M&uuml;rger, in which he sings the praises of the
Bohemia by which he died:&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor boy! It was this very &#8220;<i>orgueil simple</i>&#8221; that was his sad
undoing.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If the artist,&#8221; says Balzac in a memorable passage of his
<i>Cousine Bette</i>, &#8220;does not hurl himself into his work, like Curtius
into the gulf, without reflecting, and if, in this crater, he does not
dig like a miner buried under a land-slide, ... his work perishes
in the atelier, where production becomes impossible; and he assists
at the suicide of his talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ren&eacute; Leclerc, though no mere dawdler, as the twelve sizable
manuscripts he left behind him prove, was not endowed with either
the mental or the physical endurance to perform the Herculean
labour which Balzac both preached and practised. No more was
Louis M&mdash;&mdash; nor D&mdash;&mdash;; no more was the brilliant G&eacute;rard de
Nerval, who was found one winter morning in the rue de la Vieille
Lanterne hanging from a window-bar, nor the precocious Escousse
and Lebras, who at nineteen and sixteen respectively killed
themselves because a first phenomenal success with a drama
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
was followed by failures; no more was Chatterton in England.
Few artists are. With most of them ample time for revery is a
prerequisite condition of production. And yet the record seems
to show that suicides are relatively rare among poets and artists.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is because the record does not occupy itself with
the poets and artists, the Louis M&mdash;&mdash;s and the D&mdash;&mdash;s, who are
not known as such to the world at large. Or, perhaps, it is
because so many die in the hospital, like Gilbert, Malfil&acirc;tre,
H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe Moreau, and the Joseph D&mdash;&mdash; of M&uuml;rger&#8217;s tale; and so
many others are claimed by Charenton, like Jules Jouy, Toulouse
de Lautrec, and Andr&eacute; Gill (for bedlam is another Bohemian resort),
that suicide has no need to assert its rights. In any event,
two cardinal qualities of the artistic temperament are distinctly
hostile to self-destruction; namely, faith in the sure emergence
and supremacy of genius, and a Hamlet-like irresolution that prefers
pouring out woes on paper to ending them by an energetic
trigger-pull.</p>

<p>The despair of the victims of the <i>mis&egrave;re en habit noir</i>, who are
less able to sustain themselves by faith and who are more capable
of decisive action, is, like their dress, much blacker and more
austere; and suicides are far commoner among them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE dislike of and contempt for the bourgeois felt by the
Bohemian students and the other Bohemians who have
elected to reside in the <i>Quartier Latin</i> pale into insignificance
before the absolute detestation of the bourgeois displayed
by the <i>Quartier&#8217;s chevaliers d&#8217;industrie</i>, the hangers-on and camp-followers
of its litt&eacute;rateurs and artists, who bear about the same
relation to their principals that a side-show bears to a circus or the
capering monkey to the hand-organ and its grinder.</p>

<p>As the lackey of the nobleman often holds himself above the
commoner far more than does the nobleman himself, and as he
will rather put up with poor living and poor wages in the service
of an indigent aristocrat than demean himself by serving in the
households of tradesmen, so these ne&#8217;er-do-wells of the <i>Quartier
Latin</i>&mdash;ragged retainers of the threadbare gentry of arts and letters,
pinched flunkeys of the straightened lords of thought, seedy
clients of needy Latin patricians, tatterdemalion cup-bearers to
tattered Parnassians, supernumeraries to the protagonists in
the melodrama of cultured poverty, chorus to the soloists of the
<i>Learned Beggars&#8217; Opera</i>&mdash;would be humiliated and miserable
outside of the atmosphere of letters. They would rather be door-keepers,
to paraphrase a familiar text, in the house of the intellectual
<i>&eacute;lite</i> than to dwell in the tents of vulgarity.</p>

<p>If there is more comedy and less tragedy in the existences of
these satellites than in the existences of their controlling luminaries,
it is not because their physical hardships are fewer,&mdash;for, parasites,
sycophants, trencher-friends, pick-thanks, and toad-eaters
though they be, theirs is but sorry hap,&mdash;but because they are
mostly ambitionless or feeble-minded and so not as susceptible to
the mental torture of disenchantment.</p>

<p>They &#8220;carry the half of their mattresses in their hair,&#8221; after
the fashion of the nephew of Rameau described by Diderot. They
don the cast-off garments and retail the worn-out epigrams of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
their <i>f&eacute;tiches</i>, who are amused by and therefore endlessly indulgent
of them. They strut and smirk and rant like children
masquerading in the attic frippery of their elders, make as
clever displays of superficial knowledge as the most up-to-date
members of the most up-to-date women&#8217;s clubs, and revert constantly
to a previous connection with the university which is
not always imaginary. As individuals, these pseudo-connoisseurs
and savants come and go in the <i>Quartier Latin</i>: the class goes
on forever.</p>

<p>There are plenty of persons still living in the Latin Quarter
who knew the originals of the eccentric <i>Quartier</i> types immortalised
by Jules Vall&egrave;s in his phenomenal <i>R&eacute;fractaires</i>.</p>

<p>Fontan-Crusoe, a genuine bachelor of arts, who slept one hundred
and eleven consecutive nights under a tree near the fortifications,
spent for nourishment from three to five sous a day which
he earned by selling in the street his two principal works, <i>Le
Spectre Noir: El&eacute;gie</i> and <i>Un Galop &agrave; travers l&#8217;Espace</i>.</p>

<p>Poupelin, called also &#8220;<i>Mes Papiers</i>,&#8221; he of the enormous yellow
felt, &#8220;<i>pantalon d&#8217;enfant</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>redingote de centennaire</i>,&#8221;
who spent his time seeking titled office and recommendations
therefor, when he was not occupied in one of the three positions
which he accepted with equal alacrity and in which he was
equally efficient,&mdash;or inefficient,&mdash;namely, teacher, school usher,
and cook.</p>

<p>And M. Chaque, &#8220;<i>Orientaliste</i>,&#8221; another genuine <i>bachelier</i>,
who had a useful habit of carrying rice pudding in his hat and
omelettes and beef <i>&agrave; la mode</i> in his pockets,&mdash;ex-professor of a
colonial school; author of a volume of travels in Greece (published
by a reputable firm) with which he beset Greek enthusiasts
orally and successfully; a constant reader of the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>, to which he had, once on a time, contributed an article;
communicant of all the Christian or pagan sects that had
churches or temples in Paris; privileged hanger-on of gaming-houses
and soldiers&#8217; barracks; razor-sharpener and professional
weeper at the cemetery of Montparnasse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Two vagrant types (equally grotesque with those of Vall&egrave;s),
who are now dead, but whom one need not have been long associated
with the <i>Quartier</i> to remember, were Eug&egrave;ne Cochet
and Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Cloux.</p>

<p>Cochet was an ex-prefect of the Department of the Eure, a
rhymester and the author of an unpublished work of &#8220;philosophical
reflections,&#8221; who depended for his sustenance on the bounty
of one or two restaurants and the <i>soupes populaires</i>, and who had
a mania for decorations, like Poupelin. The students, who made
Cochet the butt of a great deal of good-natured chaffing, which
he accepted gratefully as so much tribute to his worth, formally
invested him one day with the star of the Legion of Honour (attached
to a flaming red cravat) and with the insignia of ten fantastic
foreign orders, notably with that of the Garter and that of
the Green Elephant, which last consisted of a zinc elephant,
painted green, suspended from a bailiff&#8217;s chain.</p>

<p>Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Cloux, poet, emulated the literary forgeries of Chatterton
at closer range. He had a marvellous facility for copying
poetic styles, and he got his living for a time by the deaths of
his more illustrious brother poets. As soon as a well-known
poet died, he produced imitations of his poetry, which he sold as
posthumous works. His most successful efforts, &#8220;<i>Le Chien
Mort</i>,&#8221; attributed by him to Baudelaire, and &#8220;<i>Plus de Repr&eacute;sailles</i>&#8221;
and &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Ode &agrave; la Colonne D&eacute;boulonn&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; purporting to be by
Eug&egrave;ne Vermesch, deceived both the public and the experts
until the good Cloux, who was more of a joker than a vulgar
swindler, acknowledged his ruse.</p>

<p>Of the freaks who now perch in (for they can hardly be said to
inhabit) the <i>Quartier Latin</i>, far and away the most famous is
Bibi-la-Pur&eacute;e,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;<i>Qui porte en son c&oelig;ur un vaste m&eacute;pris</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pour quiconque n&#8217;est Boh&egrave;me ni po&egrave;te.</i>&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="tb">No Parisian of the period, perhaps, has been more written about,
and none more photographed, sculptured, etched, and painted;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and none has done more to divert his time than Bibi. Bibi is
by turns an artist&#8217;s model, a sponge, a simple beggar, a shoe-black,
a tourist&#8217;s guide, a watcher of bicycles at cafe doors, a dealer
in photographs of himself and in original poems, a boon companion
of poets and artists, and a confidant and counsellor of
<i>&eacute;tudiantes</i>; but he is first, last, and all the time Bibi the fop, the
Beau Tibbs of Latium, the Beau Brummel of the Castalian
gutter.</p>

<p>The first time I saw Bibi was in 1895, at an anarchist meeting
addressed by Louise Michel, in the rue de la Montagne Ste.
Genevi&egrave;ve, back of the Panth&eacute;on. He was muffled to the eyes,
conspirator-like, in the folds of a rusty, tattered Spanish cloak,
faced with dirty red velvet, and wore besides a white yachting
cap, white skin-tight pantaloons, gaping patent leather shoes
fitted with cavalry spurs, and white gaiters.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Bibi he was pulling an unlighted cigar, and
tenderly convoying to his lodging a poet, not of the most obscure,
who had been imbibing too freely. He was dight in a red fez,
a bright green velvet waistcoat under an Inverness cape (with
no jacket intervening), a yellow silk neckerchief, cavalry boots,
and baggy brown corduroy trousers; and, if I should itemise all
the different costumes it has been my privilege to see Bibi wear
between these dates, a large octavo volume would scarcely hold the
list. Reputed in some quarters to be an ex-student, an ex-journalist,
a political refugee, and a disguised nobleman, and in others
to be a blackmailer, a swindler, a thief, a police spy, and a pander,
the mystery that envelopes Bibi&#8217;s present as well as his past&mdash;a
mystery which his autobiography, published in <i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e</i>, did appreciably
nothing to dispel&mdash;gives him a curiosity-piquing charm.</p>

<p>There is no doubt as to Bibi&#8217;s untidiness, his inordinate vanity,
his assurance, his unscrupulousness, and his genuine kindness of
heart; but beyond this all is conjecture.</p>

<p>Jehan Rictus in a recent poem, to the recitation of which (at
the <i>Noctambules</i> or the <i>Grille</i>) Bibi often listens with his inscrutable
smile, has given Bibi a large symbolic significance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bibi was a humble follower and adorer&mdash;slave almost&mdash;of Verlaine,
who playfully honored him with the following verses in his
<i>D&eacute;dicaces</i>:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>A sincere mourner for Verlaine since his death, Bibi regards it
as his special mission to cherish the cult of the dead poet&#8217;s memory.</p>

<p>The sincerity of Bibi&#8217;s mourning, however, has not prevented
him from turning an honest penny by selling the inscribed volumes
Verlaine had given him, nor from turning many a dishonest penny
by selling, as relics, copies of Verlaine&#8217;s works supplied with forged
inscriptions, and numerous other objects Verlaine never saw.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bibi&#8217;s zeal, Verlaine&#8217;s last cane and last pipe have
been multiplied, like &#8220;the only true cross,&#8221; and have taken up
their abodes in the poetic shrines of two hemispheres.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to think of Bibi without thinking of the M&egrave;re
Casimir, lately deceased, who was, for some reason, Bibi&#8217;s most
cordial aversion.</p>

<p>The M&egrave;re Casimir was a tiny, twisted, shrivelled old flower-woman,
who claimed to be an <i>ex-danseuse</i> of the <i>Op&eacute;ra</i> and to have
had for friends &#8220;princes and marquises,&#8221; and who was ready at
any moment, in consideration of a few sous, to prove it by executing
certain grotesque Terpsichorean movements on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>While the M&egrave;re Casimir was still alive, there was nothing that
delighted the students more than bringing about an encounter
between her and Bibi, and hearing the pair blackguard each other.
Only once, so far as history records, was there a truce between
them,&mdash;a certain <i>Mi-car&ecirc;me</i>, when, Bibi having been elected king
and the M&egrave;re Casimir queen of the f&ecirc;te, they paraded the streets of
Paris together in the same car. On that day the antipathetic
pair were so impressed with the dignities and responsibilities
of their position that they treated each other with royal magnanimity.
Bibi even went farther than strict etiquette required.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
In descending from his throne at the breaking up of the cort&egrave;ge,
he gallantly fell to his knees,&mdash;sight for gods and men!&mdash;and
kissed the hand of his queen.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Soudin, a long-haired but relatively neat little
man, with the noiseless step of a bird, who makes crayon portraits,
at ten sous per head, at the <i>Grille</i> and the <i>Noctambules</i> and
in the all-night restaurants of the <i>Halles Centrales</i>, is as much of
a mystery in his way as Bibi, though he has lived in the <i>Quartier</i>
more than twenty-five years. He is said to have been crossed in
love early in life, and his title is believed by many to be genuine.
However that may be, the little Soudin has the education and
manners of a gentleman, and <i>noblesse oblige</i> inspires his conduct.
He does no offence to any, and is a veritable providence to
his poorer fellow-Bohemians. M. le Marquis makes poems as
well as portraits, but not for money. &#8220;At least no merchant
traffics in his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist bard of P&egrave;re Lunette&#8217;s,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> who makes crayon portraits
at ten sous a head, like the little marquis, and poems for money,
unlike the little marquis, is also supposed by many to be of noble
origin. He is a dashing, handsome fellow, with the felt and the
swagger of a <i>mousquetaire</i>, and is, when he chooses to quit the
vulgar r&ocirc;le his position at P&egrave;re Lunette&#8217;s imposes upon him, a
lively and stimulating conversationalist. In summer, with his
bosom friend P&egrave;re Jules, he tramps the country roads of France.</p>

<p>Achille Leroy, philosopher and poet (the anarchist author-editor-publisher-bookseller,
referred to in the chapter on the
oral propaganda of the anarchists), is another favourite with the
students, upon whose quizzical, good-natured patronage he depends
mainly for the sale of his wares.</p>

<p>Some years back, at the moment of the anarchist &#8220;Terror,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Achille, whose illusions regarding his intellect are on a par with
those of Bibi regarding his person, offered himself as a candidate
for the Academy. He made the customary &#8220;visits&#8221; to the Academicians
attired in the uniform of a Mexican general, and wherever
he was not received left an ominous-looking brass kettle to
which, along with his visiting card, this inscription was attached:</p>

<div class="poem padl2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;<i>Je ne fais sauter que les id&eacute;es.</i>&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Other contemporary freaks who help to swell the picturesqueness
and gaiety of the <i>Quartier</i> are: the anarchist cobbler <i>chansonnier</i>
P&egrave;re La Purge (author of the <i>Chanson du P&egrave;re La Purge</i>,
quoted in a previous chapter), whose customers (mainly the poets
and artists of the <i>Quartier</i>) visit his shop in the rue de la Parcheminerie
to enjoy the piquancy of the contrast between his ruddy,
contented face and his anathemas against society; Gaillepand, a
big, athletic-looking fellow, who, having failed to earn a living by
legitimate sculpture, took to making plaster medallions of the celebrities
of Paris, especially those of the <i>Quartier</i>, and selling them
up and down the Boulevard St. Michel, while his brother &#8220;<i>M&ocirc;me
l&#8217;Histoire</i>&#8221; (now dead) displayed his phenomenal memory by reciting
biographies and poems; the M&egrave;re Souris (Mother Mouse),
so called from her conical head and her funny little walk, ex-proprietor
of an artists&#8217; restaurant and present palmist, fortune-teller,
and reputed usurer,&mdash;in short, a very useful personage to the
<i>&eacute;tudiantes</i>; Victor Sainbault, author, editor, publisher, and book-seller,
like Achille Leroy; and the poet Coulet, who gives author&#8217;s
readings before the terraces of the caf&eacute;s, and who between times, if
hearsay may be credited, provides petty bourgeois families with
wedding, christening, and funeral verses at so much per yard.</p>

<p>It is because these freaks take themselves seriously, because
they are unconscious humourists and involuntary <i>farceurs</i>, that
they are amusing. But the <i>Quartier</i> has always had among its
choicer Bohemians a class of conscious, almost professional humourists
and deliberate <i>farceurs</i>, called <i>fumistes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> who by drolly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
expressing their very disrespect for life have done much to make
life worth the living.</p>

<p>The most renowned of the <i>Quartier fumistes</i> who practised
when those now in middle life were young was unquestionably
Sapeck.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Verily,&#8221; says Emile Goudeau, &#8220;I owe a taper to Sapeck for
having initiated me into this inner folly which manifests itself
outwardly by imperturbable buffooneries.... Better to have kept
alive, thanks to <i>insouciance</i>, than to have died stoically of <i>mis&egrave;re</i>,
wrapped in the cloak of a Byronian hero. If we occasionally
exceeded the proper limits of the laugh, at least we did not light
the brazier of Escousse nor seek the rope of G&eacute;rard de Nerval;
and that is something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sapeck is very likely dead now. At any rate, he is dead to the
Quarter. But, as he was the successor (according to the arch&aelig;ologists
of <i>fumisterie</i>) of Romien and Vivier, so he has his successors,
one of whom the <i>rapin</i> Karl, mystifier of Quesnay de Beaurepaire
and abductor of the Comtesse Martel (&#8220;Gyp&#8221;), has almost
earned the right to be regarded as his peer. Zo d&#8217;Axa, who is
less a <i>fumiste</i> than he has it in him to be, because he takes time
to be a serious and talented author and to serve sentences in prison
for his opinions, perpetrated a <i>fumisterie</i> some five years back
that has taken an honourable place among the classics of its
kind.</p>

On a warm Sunday in May, while the people
crowded to the urns, the white jackass, the
candidate <i>Nul</i>, enthroned on a triumphal car
drawn by electors, traversed Paris, his <i>bonne

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;They are insulting us,&#8217; bellowed some. &#8216;They are ridiculing
universal suffrage,&#8217; protested others more justly. Some one shook
his fist at the jackass furiously, and said, &#8216;<i>Sale Juif!</i>&#8217; (Dirty Jew),
but a laugh burst out, and spread sonorous. The candidate was
acclaimed. Bravely the elector made fun of himself and of his
representatives. Hats and canes were waved. Ladies threw
flowers. The jackass passed.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He descended from the heights of Montmartre, going towards
the <i>Quartier Latin</i>. He crossed the Grands-Boulevards, the Croissant,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
where is cooked, without salt, the <i>ordinaire</i> served by the
gazettes. He saw the <i>halles</i> (markets) where the starving glean
in the heaps of garbage, the quays where electors elect lodgings
under the bridges.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Heart and brain! Paris! Democracy!...</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The jackass arrived before the Senate.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He skirted the palace, whence the guard emerged hurriedly.
He followed, on the outside, alas! the too-green gardens. Then
came the Boulevard St. Michel. On the terraces of the caf&eacute;s
the youth of the <i>Quartier</i> clapped their hands. The crowd, constantly
growing, snatched out of each other&#8217;s hands the jackass&#8217;s
proclamations. The students harnessed themselves to the car,
a professor pushed the wheels; but it struck three, and the police
appeared.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Since ten o&#8217;clock that morning, from post to commissariat,
the telegraph and the telephone had signalled the strange passage
of the subversive animal. The order was issued: &#8216;Arrest the jackass!&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
And now the police sergeants barred the route of the candidate.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Near the Place St. Michel, the faithful committee of <i>Nul</i>
was ordered by the armed force to conduct its candidate to the
nearest police station. Naturally, the committee paid no attention,
and kept on its way. The car crossed the Seine, and soon
it halted before the <i>Palais de Justice</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The police, re-enforced, surrounded the white jackass, the
impassive jackass. The candidate was arrested at the gate of this
<i>Palais de Justice</i>, whence deputies, defaulters, <i>panamistes</i>, all
the big thieves, go out free.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In the midst of the surging crowd the car swayed as if about
to capsize. The police, a brigadier at their head, had seized the
shafts and donned the straps. The committee insisted no more:
they helped harness the <i>sergents de ville</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Thus the white jackass was abandoned by his warmest partisans.
Like any other vulgar politician, the animal had come to
a bad end. The police towed him, authority guided his route.
<i>From this moment Nul was only an official candidate.</i> His
friends acknowledged him no more. The door of the prefecture
opened wide, and the jackass entered quite as if he were entering
his own stall.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">What has all this starving and self-killing and freakishness and
practical joking of the <i>Quartier</i> Bohemians to do with revolution?
Much every way.</p>

<p>Jules Vall&egrave;s (all his life a Latin Quarter Bohemian), whom
Richepin has characterised as &#8220;the most curious and the most complete
of the <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;s</i> of the pen&#8221;; of whom his intimate friend Gill
said, &#8220;He would be the tenderest, the most <i>spirituel</i>, the most
charming, and the most eloquent fellow in the world, were it not
for the mania which possesses him to believe himself at ease only
in the smoke of battles or the bawlings of the faubourgs&#8221;; who
presented himself at the elections of 1869 as &#8220;<i>le candidat de la
mis&egrave;re</i>,&#8221; and put at the head of his second volume of <i>Jacques
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Vingtras</i> (<i>Le Bachelier</i>), &#8220;<i>A ceux qui nourris de Grec et de Latin
sont morts de faim, je d&eacute;die ce livre</i>,&#8221;&mdash;Jules Vall&egrave;s (and who should
know better than Vall&egrave;s?) said, not long before the Commune
was declared:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In this life there is a danger. <i>Mis&egrave;re</i> without a flag conducts
to the <i>mis&egrave;re</i> that has a flag, and makes of the scattered <i>r&eacute;fractaires</i>
an army which counts in its ranks less sons of the people
than sons of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Behold them bearing down upon us,
pale, mute, emaciated, beating the charge with the bones of their
martyrs upon the drum of the <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;s</i>, and waving as a standard,
at the point of a sword, the blood-stained shirt of the last of their
suicides!...</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;These <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;s</i> must find places, or they will have revenge; and
this is why so much absinthe runs down their throats and so
much blood upon the paving-stones. They become drunkards
or rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again, in the introduction to his <i>R&eacute;fractaires</i>, he says,
&#8220;Give me three hundred of these men, any sort of a flag, toss me
down there before the regiments in a raking fire, and you shall
see what short work I will make of the gunners at the head of my
<i>r&eacute;fractaires</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every convulsion Paris has undergone has proved the truth of
Vall&egrave;s&#8217; mordant sentences. What was the Commune, indeed, but
the joint self-assertion of the <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;s</i>?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>D&eacute;class&eacute;s</i>,&#8221; wrote Richepin of the leaders of the Commune
shortly after its suppression, &#8220;from the unrecognised general, Cluseret,
to the unappreciated caricaturist, Pilotell; from the intelligent
deputy, Milli&egrave;re, to the lunatic, Allix; from the great painter,
Courbet, to the ex-monk, Panille, and <i>tutti quanti</i>; <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;s</i>
of politics, like Delescluze and Pyat, of journalism and of
literature, like Vall&egrave;s, Vermesch, Vermorel, Grousset, V&eacute;sinier,
Maroleau; of the army, like Rossel, of the workshop, like Assi,
of the <i>brasserie</i>, like Rigault, of lower still, like Johamard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all these starving, suiciding, freakish, jesting Latin Quarter
Bohemians are conscious socialists and anarchists, though there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
is a good proportion of them who are,&mdash;a greater proportion
probably than among the students proper, by as much as their
situations are more precarious; but they nearly all hold vaguely
subversive humanitarian views, and they are all, even the Bohemians
by choice, <i>r&eacute;fractaires</i> and <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;s</i>. Like the Th&eacute;l&eacute;mites of
Rabelais, they all recognise but the one law which is no law,&mdash;&#8220;<i>Fay
ce que vouldras.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Their way of living is a species of the <i>propagande par l&#8217;exemple</i>
from which it is a quick and easy step to the <i>propagande par le
fait</i>. Given a crisis, <i>r&eacute;fractaire</i>, <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;</i>, and <i>r&eacute;volutionnaire</i> spell
very much the same thing. They are all ripe for disorder.</p>

<p>The victims of the <i>mis&egrave;re en habit noir</i>&mdash;the poor doctors, teachers,
lawyers, petty functionaries, and clerks&mdash;are, in the nature
of the case, more submissive to their fate than the free-living
freaks, litt&eacute;rateurs, and artists; but there are evidences that they,
too, are beginning to think of stepping over the bounds within
which patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>M. Paul Webre, one of a group of young men of means and
education&mdash;evolutionists, not revolutionists&mdash;who have pursued
the laboratory method of studying the conditions, the psychology,
and the relations to society of various employments, has given
the following testimony to the expectant, if unaggressive, attitude
of the small clerks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;My relatively frail health forbidding me work in a factory,
I sought a place as a clerk. After twenty ineffectual applications
I succeeded in crossing the threshold of an insurance company.
I earn there 100 francs a month, on which I manage to live
without resorting to my income. I carry with me in the morning
a lunch of bread, cheese, and a slice of ham or sausage, and I talk
with my comrades of the office. Some are married. These are
the most unfortunate; but they reflect that, if they quit their meagre
situations, there are innumerable persons in the streets ready to
vie with each other to obtain them, and they cling to them for
dear life. Nevertheless, their hatred is brooding. While taking
cold bites during the hour of respite which the avaricious administration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
accords us, we pass our chiefs in review, and compare
their profits with our own. The director has a salary of 100,000
francs, the president is several times a millionaire; while we, <i>morbleu</i>!
Oh, the monotonous days! the repulsive work! the ominous
end of the month! and the certainty of plodding along for twenty
years in the same fashion, only to be sent away at last without
resource! It is poverty in the frayed frock-coat, the worst poverty.
I have tried to organise the discontented, but they have
a terror of compromising themselves and of making themselves
marks for the Company&#8217;s blows. So, bending over their documents,
they spy the growlings in the street, ready to descend there,
in their turn, when the revolution asserts itself. The atmosphere
in which these petty clerks stagnate is saturated with bitterness,
with rancours, with regrets, with deceived ambitions. Terrible
eruptions are being prepared therein. And I cry to the
capitalists: &#8216;Take care! Transform these enemies into friends,
these anarchists into conservators! Share your profits with them.
Throw them a honey-cake while there is still time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE official restoration at the Carnival of 1896 of the
historic but long unobserved f&ecirc;te of the <i>B&oelig;uf Gras</i>
(Fat Ox) was the signal for the creation of the f&ecirc;te of the
<i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> (Famished Cow) for that year&#8217;s <i>Mi-car&ecirc;me</i> by the
denizens of Montmartre.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Over against the <i>B&oelig;uf Gras</i>, father of the golden calf, emblem
of the wealth and prosperity of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>,&#8221; said the committee
of organisation in its public manifesto, &#8220;the painters, poets,
and <i>chansonniers</i> of the Mont des Martyrs have prepared for the
pleasure and edification of the Parisians a spectacle which they
call the Cavalcade of the <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> (or the <i>Vachalcade</i>), intended
to present the picture, sometimes poignant, of their struggles,
their sufferings, their ideals, their chasings after phantoms,
their unrealised dreams, their often illusory hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This brand-new cavalcade consisted of a large number of pedestrians
masquerading as ducks, geese, rabbits, frogs, camels,
donkeys, cats, pigs, and giraffes (the French words for all of which
have well-defined metaphorical meanings), and as chimeras,
Pierrots and Pierrettes; and a score or more of fantastic floats
(designed by Montmartre artists of repute), the subtle and piquant
symbolism of which was all Greek to the foreign tourists who
chanced to see them and not too intelligible to many Parisians
who fancied they knew their Paris and their French. The floats
were entitled (to mention only those whose significance is fairly
obvious) <i>Pegasus Seized by the Sheriffs</i>, <i>The Anti-Landlord
League</i>, <i>The Wrestlers of Thought</i>, <i>The Temple of the Golden Calf</i>,
<i>La Vache Enrag&eacute;e through the Ages</i>, <i>Feeding of la Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>,
<i>Drawing the Teeth of la Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, <i>A la Belle Etoile</i>,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and <i>Ma

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Judges were satirically represented as side-whiskered caf&eacute;
gar&ccedil;ons; the victims of <i>la mis&egrave;re en habit noir</i>, as street pavers,
attired in frayed frock-coats, wind-traversed shoes, and weather-beaten
&#8220;plug&#8221; hats; and <i>Les Jeunes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> as small boys, in dunce-caps,

<p>The street parade lasted from mid-day to sunset. It was preceded
by a theatrical representation for the benefit of destitute
artists, which included appropriate skits by the Montmartre playwrights
Xanrof and Court&eacute;line, an address by the Montmartre
socialist poet-deputy Clovis Hugues, and rapid platform drawing
by the Montmartre caricaturists, Pal and Gr&uuml;n; and it was followed
by bonfires and open-air dancing, and by a masked ball
at the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, in the course of which a lottery was drawn,
whose principal prizes were sketches by Montmartre artists,
among them Faverot, Willette, Henri Pille, Roedel, L&eacute;andre,
and Puvis de Chavannes. The occasion was further signalised
by the publication of a magazine, <i>La Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, under the
editorship of Willette.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of the second and last<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> f&ecirc;te of the <i>Vache</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
<i>Enrag&eacute;e</i> (1897) was a musical poem, entitled &#8220;<i>Le Couronnement
de la Muse de Montmartre</i>,&#8221; by the Montmartre composer Gustave
Charpentier, now thrice famous as the author of <i>Louise</i>,
in which Labour, figured by one Mlle. Stumpp (a working-girl,
who had been elected by ballot the Montmartre Muse), was crowned
by Beauty, figured by Cl&eacute;o de M&eacute;rode. Charpentier interpreted
his cantata as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The Muse is the plebeian virgin, the virtuous young working-girl,
the daughter of the people, administering a formidable slap
in the face to the <i>p&egrave;res la pudeur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> showing these drivellers of
another epoch, these dotards whose sentiments are false, unnatural,
and bourgeois, that it is possible to achieve the beautiful
in taking for a queen an <i>ouvri&egrave;re</i>, a <i>rosi&egrave;re</i> even, of Montmartre,
region of ideals too young for their too old ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Montmartre f&ecirc;te of the <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> is unique among
the f&ecirc;tes of the whole world, I fancy, in that it is at once a bold
apotheosis of the racking poverty of the artistic career and a defiant,
masterful sneer at the smugness of commercial Philistinism.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
&#8220;It is a defence of <i>la mis&egrave;re</i> you are making,&#8221; said Zola in a communication
to its organisers,&mdash;&#8220;a defence of <i>la mis&egrave;re</i>; and, to
my thinking, you are right in making this defence.&#8221; Cyrano,
a knight of the <i>vache enrag&eacute;e</i>, who would have found himself
delightfully at home in the Montmartre cavalcade, made a similar
defence, according to Rostand, some centuries ago:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">The device, <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, cavalierly adopted as their catchword
by the painters, sculptors, poets, and musicians of Montmartre,
was taken directly from the title of a Montmartre romance
by Emile Goudeau, who was named on that account honorary
president of the festival; but the phrase had long been current in
French conversation and literature to designate the poverty of
the <i>prol&eacute;tariat artistique et litt&eacute;raire</i>. Thus, the great Daudet
wrote regarding one of the characters of <i>Jack</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Then commenced for him this terrible ordeal of the <i>vache
enrag&eacute;e</i>, which either breaks you at once or bronzes you forever.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He became one of the ten thousand poor devils, famished and
proud, who rise in Paris every morning giddy with hunger and
ambitious dreams, nibble surreptitiously a sou loaf, which they
keep hidden away in the bottoms of their pockets, blacken their
clothes with penfuls of ink, whiten their shirt collars with billiard
chalk, and warm themselves over the registers of the libraries
and churches.... Art is such a wizard! It creates a sun which
shines for all, like Nature&#8217;s sun; and those who approach it, even
the poor, even the ill-favoured, even the grotesque, carry away a
little of its warmth and its radiance. This celestial flame, imprudently
ravished, which the unsuccessful guard in the depths of
their eyes, renders them redoubtable sometimes, oftenest ridiculous;
but their existence gains from it a grandiose serenity, a contemptuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
indifference to misfortune, and a grace in suffering that other
kinds of poverty do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Montmartre <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, you see, is the same old Latin
Quarter <i>Mis&egrave;re</i> under another label, the &#8220;Bohemian road by which
every man who enters the arts without other means of existence
than art itself will be forced to travel, ... the training school of
the artistic profession, the preface to the Academy, the <i>H&ocirc;tel-Dieu</i>,
or the Morgue.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

and it was late autumn) because he could not pay the small
bridge toll which was then exacted&mdash;<i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>!</p>

<p>The saturnine De Nerval and the brilliant Gauthier chasing
dinners, the first in back alley-ways and the second in the salon
of the Princesse Mathilde&mdash;<i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>!</p>

<p><i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, also, young Balzac living on a few sous a day
and writing the inevitable five-act drama in an icy garret, because
his father, who had intended the boy for the law, had said to him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
&#8220;There are people who have a vocation for dying in the hospital,&#8221;
and his mother, &#8220;It seems that monsieur has a taste for misery!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>&mdash;young Daudet arriving in Paris, after an
over-long fast, shod only with rubbers (as he has narrated in
<i>Trente Ans</i> and <i>Le Petit Chose</i>), and existing there on his share of
the seventy-five francs a month his brother Ernest earned!</p>

<p>And <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>&mdash;young Zola stifling in a &#8220;room under
the roof where one was forced to perform a series of acrobatic
feats to sit down&mdash;on the bed&#8221;; living several days on bread soaked
in olive oil sent to him from the Midi, and pitifully imploring the
editors of <i>Le Travail</i> (a little Latin Quarter review) to print for
him a poem written in the style of De Musset!</p>

<p><i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> again&mdash;Eug&egrave;ne Boudin sighing in his journal:
&#8220;There are moments hard to bear when on every side you see the
impossibility of getting a little money. There is a poor old mother
who entreats, there is the rent to pay, there is the necessity of
clothes, of brushes, of canvases, which you finally have to get
along without. Petty economy and the worry that accompanies
it kill you by inches.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, in short, the privations of all those for whom
liberty is a necessity, and beauty a religion, and with whom a glowing
faith in art more than atones for the absence of bread, of fire,
and of clothes!</p>

<p>Winter before last a painter, fifty-three years of age, well known
in art circles, was detected extracting money out of a church poor-box
with the aid of a glue-smeared stick. This revolting sort
of infidelity to the hard fare of the <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> is, it need hardly
be said, a rare occurrence; but it is not rare for men to be forced
to familiarity with the <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i> after they have become
famous.</p>

<p>Glatigny never got entirely free of poverty, and it was of disease
produced by hunger and exposure that both he and his wife died.</p>

<p>At the height of his fame the critic Gustave Planche was often
without money enough to go to the barber-shop,&mdash;if Vall&egrave;s is
to be believed,&mdash;and occupied an attic at twenty-five francs a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
month. He never earned more than four thousand francs a year,
and rarely as much as three thousand francs,&mdash;a sum which was
destitution, nothing more nor less, for a person whose vocation
forced him into the world and whose inability to walk necessitated
a perpetual outlay for carriage hire.</p>

<p>In a striking passage of his novel, <i>La Faiseuse de Gloire</i>, Paul
Brulat writes: &#8220;An old man approached the desk timidly, and
stammered something in a low voice. The editor, annoyed at
being interrupted, repelled him with cruel words. &#8216;Oh, say now,
won&#8217;t you ever stop coming here begging?&#8217; The old man moved
off with a senile shake of the head. He bore a great name in
literature. He was called Villiers de l&#8217;Isle-Adam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Becque, whose <i>Corbeaux</i> was refused by ten theatres
before it was accepted by the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, &#8220;lived on a seventh
floor, under the roof,&#8221; says his friend and admirer, Henri Bauer.
&#8220;The furnishings of his single room were an iron bed, an unpainted
table, and three straw-bottomed chairs.&#8221; And this was long
after Becque&#8217;s masterpieces had been given a hearing, at a time
when he was regarded by a large and influential group of his contemporaries
as the greatest French dramatist the last half of the
nineteenth century had produced.</p>

<p>Berlioz, Millet, Verlaine, and H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe Moreau ate of the
<i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>, more or less regularly, all their lives. So have
many other artistic natures, not the least worthy and not the least
celebrated.</p>

<p>Franz Servais, after having given fifteen years of labour, at
untold sacrifice, to the creation and perfection of his opera, <i>L&#8217;Apollonide</i>,
won the support of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar only
to have his patron die just as the preparations for the production
of the opera were complete and to die himself a few days after.
In a letter to a friend, Servais has related how on one occasion,
when everything looked dark, he missed an almost certain order
from a musical publisher for want of presentable shoes: &#8220;I was
unable to keep the appointment. At the last moment I perceived
that my best shoes were all broken open. They gaped at the ends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
like carps&#8217; noses. You can imagine the face of the good editor,
his regret for having offered me a little money, and how he would
have torn up the contract! I must wait for better luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Franz Servais took himself too tragically in letting a good thing
escape him simply because he had holes in his shoes. But Servais,
though identified with Paris, was a Belgian, not a Frenchman,
by birth, and was not a <i>Montmartrois</i>.</p>

<p>With a remunerative offer as an incentive, your typical <i>Montmartrois</i>
would not have taken more than fifteen minutes to beg,
borrow, or steal, hire or buy on the strength of the offer itself or
of a supposititious heritage, the necessary shoes, and would have
celebrated the happy outcome with his friends the very same night.
Resourcefulness is a salient trait of the Bohemian wherever he
may be found, and of none more than of the Bohemian of Montmartre.
His contrivances for making the pot boil are legion.</p>

<p>In a tight place, he utilises the erudition, of which he is ordinarily
more than half ashamed, in teaching foreigners French, working
on cyclopedias or dictionaries, and giving lessons in the &#8220;three
Rs,&#8221; for a few sous a day, to the children of his <i>conci&egrave;rge</i>. He
gives lessons just as readily in dancing, fencing, sparring, and
<i>savate</i>.</p>

<p>If his talents are literary, he contributes to diet and fashion
journals, writes advertisements or puffs for trade organs, sings
songs of his own composition in the streets, or prints original
poetry on slips and sells it in the caf&eacute;s. He reads and writes letters
at so much a piece for illiterate neighbours, supplies street singers
(at a nominal price) with words for their songs, makes almost
presentable (by editing) the productions of snobs, and constructs
for <i>feuilletonistes</i> romances which said <i>feuilletonistes</i> sign. He
writes indifferently theses for students, brochures for pamphleteers,
placards and palaver for strolling showmen, prospectuses for
charlatans, anniversary rhymes for husbands or wives, god-parents
or god-children, toasts for empty-pated banqueters, and
funeral speeches or elegies for unimaginative mourners. If his
gift is musical, he plays in night orchestras. If his gift is artistic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
he poses as a model for his companions of the chisel and brush
who chance to be in funds, copies old masters at ten to fifteen
francs a picture, designs posters and daubs scenery for the f&ecirc;tes
of the faubourgs, colours crude religious prints for the provincial
market, paints workingmen&#8217;s children in their first communion
regalia, and makes portraits for fond widows and widowers&mdash;between
demise and burial&mdash;of their dear deceased. If his health
is particularly robust, he figures the cured patient in quack
doctors&#8217; waiting-rooms.</p>

<p>He may, quite regardless of his bent, hawk toys in the street on
f&ecirc;te days, play the races (under sealed orders) for a friend too busy
to attend, fish tadpoles in the suburbs for the reptiles of menageries,
help out a small shopkeeper with his book-keeping, back envelopes
for a big bazaar, perform the duties of a valet under the
euphuistic title of secretary, and advertise wares by demanding
them insistently where they are not kept. He may even make
himself a printer&#8217;s, house painter&#8217;s, mason&#8217;s, blacksmith&#8217;s, or
carpenter&#8217;s assistant, a market porter, or a <i>d&eacute;m&eacute;nageur</i> (mover).
In all these contingencies, however, the immediate need having
been satisfied, he takes up again his normal autonomous existence.
He has not bound himself to lasting servitude. He has not
sold his soul, and it is a rare thing that he is seriously demoralised
by his half-humorous concessions. On the other hand, he
has touched life at new points, deepened his sentiments, broadened
his human sympathies, and lifted his horizon without lowering
his ideal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Implacable sausage!&#8221; cries the author of <i>Le Dimanche d&#8217;un
Jeune Homme Pauvre</i>. &#8220;We do not give sufficient credit to the
influence of the hog on literature! I know men of letters <i>en
route</i> for the Academy who ate kilometres of <i>boudin</i> [blood pudding]
during the hard years of their novitiate.&#8221; This is merely a
highly concrete way of saying that the French Bohemian is much
less exercised over the savouriness of food than over its staying
power. The problem he has to solve oftenest is not how most to
tickle his palate, but how to give his system the maximum of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
bracing at the minimum of expense. To the solution of this problem,
the <i>Montmartrois</i> brings an address that is amazing. So long
as he can keep in the good graces of his <i>restaurateur</i> or of his
butcher, baker, grocer, and sausage-man by painting handsome
portraits of them and of their families or by flooding them with
inscribed copies of his poems, the equation is a simple one, and
all goes easily enough. But when the inevitable day of reckoning
comes for him, when credit is withdrawn, and all relations with
these well-nigh indispensable individuals are incontinently snapped;
when, furthermore, he has dined with his friend the interne, J&mdash;&mdash;,
at the hospital table with his friend the sergeant, K&mdash;&mdash;, in the
sub-officers&#8217; mess, and with his former classmates, the Baron
Y&mdash;&mdash; and the leather merchant X&mdash;&mdash;, in their homes, and when
he has made the round of the <i>c&eacute;nacles</i> at which he is welcome for
the verses he recites, the stories he tells, or the songs he sings,&mdash;then
the simple equation becomes an affected quadratic one,
and a lugubrious change comes over the spirit of his dreams.
Then bread and <i>boudin</i>, bread and cheese, bread and a sou&#8217;s
worth of the meat kept for dogs, or bread helped down with a glass
of <i>vin ordinaire</i> at the corner wine-shop, are the most that he can
hope to obtain, unless, like Zola, he takes to snaring sparrows on
the house-top, and roasting them, spitted on a curtain rod, by way
of a brochette.</p>

<p>If the bread and cheese and the bread and wine also fail, if
the <i>boudin</i> has to be put into the category of the unattainable
along with beefsteak, and if the sparrows are coy, he may join the
cats, dogs, and rag-pickers in exploring the garbage boxes at the
break of morning; but he usually prefers&mdash;perhaps because he
does not easily accommodate himself to early rising&mdash;some less
direct, more diplomatic proceeding, such as tasting the stock of
the market and street venders with the fastidious air of an intending
buyer. Thus, walking up to a barrow of strawberries:
&#8220;Your strawberries look good. How do you sell them?&#8221; &#8220;Four
sous a pound.&#8221; &#8220;May I taste them?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He munches and savours two or three berries attentively, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
if almost convinced of their merit, puts his hand into his pocket
and draws out his purse as if to order, but, tasting another berry
as he does so, makes a wry face, and ejaculates, &#8220;No, no, they&#8217;ll
never do at all: they&#8217;re too sour,&#8221; and moves on to another barrow.</p>

<p>Berry by berry, slowly, but surely, he amasses a meal, as the
miser amasses his hoard; and, if he has the luck to get a sou&#8217;s
worth of bread with which to punctuate his butter, cheese, and
fruit tastings, the result is not half a gastronomic failure. Happy,
however, the taster whose crisis of penury coincides with the opening
of the &#8220;Ham Fair&#8221;!</p>

<p>Picking petty quarrels for the sake of the substantial festivity
that is likely to accompany the making up and betting on its
eating capacity are other favourite ways for penniless hunger to
satisfy itself.</p>

<p>Catulle Mend&egrave;s, who made the acquaintance of the <i>Vache
Enrag&eacute;e</i> during the brief period when his family were unsympathetic
with his aims, tells of a poet, presumably himself, who
after thirty-six hours of abstinence succeeded in breaking his fast
by making a gingerbread bet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The poet eyed the sweets wistfully, eyed them long.... He
was just going away, I know not where, in the direction of the
river perhaps, when he heard his name called. It was some one
he scarcely knew, a young man also, not a poet, met somewhere
by chance.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;How hard you look at that gingerbread!&#8217; he said. The poet
replied with gravity, &#8216;It is because I adore it.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Really?&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Yes, to distraction. There are days when I could eat a
franc&#8217;s worth at a sitting.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re joking. I bet you the franc you can&#8217;t eat as many
as you say.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;I take you up,&#8217; cried the <i>Parnassien</i>, with starveling enthusiasm;
and he precipitated himself upon the stall, and devoured the
gingerbreads,&mdash;would have eaten of them for still greater, for
enormous, sums,&mdash;taking pains to choose the pieces without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
almonds, which were poorer in quality, but which were bigger
for the price. It was thus that he did not die of hunger.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is said that Ibsen in his early days of poverty before the publication
of <i>Brand</i> made it an invariable rule to take a long walk at
noon, whether he had the money for a meal or not, in order not
to lose caste&mdash;and hence credit&mdash;with his landlady by revealing
that he could not dine as often as every day. Similarly the Montmartre
Bohemian displays a fine pathetico-humorous ingenuity
in making others believe he has eaten when he has not, and even&mdash;supreme
prestidigitation!&mdash;in making himself believe it: as when
he passes the day in bed or puts his watch back to cheat his appetite;
when he takes his <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> in the middle of the afternoon,
not only to get a dinner at the price of a <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, but to afford
himself the illusion of having both; or when he makes the Heaven-sent
<i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> that should precede or the gratuitous cigar that should
follow a dinner, stand him in the stead of the dinner itself.</p>

<p>His so-called affectations and poses&mdash;bizarre accoutrement

<span class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="f268" id="f268"></a><img src="images/f268.png" width="200" height="353"

<span class="captionc">MONTMARTRE TYPES</span></span>

and outlandish speech&mdash;are, in the last analysis,
so many devices for cheap living, so many expedients
for disguising the completeness of his
destitution from his fellows and from
himself, so many talismans for metamorphosing
a hard necessity into an
idiosyncrasy of genius, or so many
modes of whistling, so to speak, to keep
up his courage. Thus Goudeau, under
the stress of exceptional ill-hap, consecrated
himself solemnly to playing
practical jokes in a <i>phalanst&egrave;re</i>; and
the rotund and rippling Raoul Ponchon
flaunted a splendid Breton costume
at the very time he had nothing
better than a wash-house to sleep in.</p>

<p>If the <i>Montmartrois</i> carries his hat
in his hand with a distrait, philosophical air,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
it is certain that the last piece of head-gear Providence
has vouchsafed him is either too large or too small for
his head. If he speaks feelingly of his old aunt, he is referring
indubitably to the pawn-shop, whose quotations are of far more
moment to him than are those of the Bourse. If you detect him
in a railway station, waiting more than half an hour for a train,
it is that the shelter of the caf&eacute; has been, for some reason or other,
temporarily denied him. And, if he appears more than half a
mile from his lodging in dressing-gown and slippers, with a salad
or a bunch of radishes under his arm, it is either because dressing-gown
and slippers are, for the nonce, the sum of his wardrobe
or because he has put on the dressing-gown to match compulsory
slippers or the slippers to match a compulsory dressing-gown.
You may be sure he has carried the salad or radishes ever since
he set out, and that he will renew them when they have become
too withered to serve his deceitful end.</p>

<p><br /><br />He carries his burdens buoyantly, as the best type of old man
carries his years, and, making hard necessity pass for a joke,
extracts no end of amusement from his vicissitudes, caps himself
with a Merry Andrew&#8217;s bonnet, and &#8220;drapes himself,&#8221; to use a
phrase of Maurice Barr&egrave;s, &#8220;with irony in order not to appear
stark naked before men.&#8221;</p>

<p>A young couple, who had long been habitu&eacute;s of a certain restaurant
in the rue Lepic, entered one night equipped with violin
and guitar, made profound obeisance to the assembled company,
and announced that they had got to earn their dinner on
the spot that night, if they had one. With their instruments and
voices they proceeded to earn it, amid their own and their whilom
comrades&#8217; jests and laughter. After a fortnight of this unenviable,
if mirthful, prominence, their fortunes mended; and they
dropped contentedly back into their obscurity as ordinary diners,
the richer for an invigorating experience. Three handsome,
long-haired, bearded fellows of the rue Menessier have taken
Paris by storm this very summer with their mandolin and guitar
music in the open air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>A Montmartre Bohemian, who is at once a superior musician
and a species of Hercules, having made himself provisionally a
<i>d&eacute;m&eacute;nageur</i>, amused himself mightily at his work, confounding the
petty bourgeois he served, by playing their pianos. The natural
though totally unforeseen result of his somewhat impudent facetiousness
was an opportunity to give lessons, which floated him
back into the musical current.</p>

<p>Another <i>Montmartrois</i> (Raoul Pouchon, I think), wearied
with walking the streets the night after he had been evicted from
his lodging, revenged himself by baiting with sugar all the street
curs of his district, and introducing them at two o&#8217;clock in the
morning into the stairway of his evictor&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Sometimes, perhaps, these merry Montmartre shifts come near
transgressing the bounds which separate fun from lawlessness.
The <i>d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement &agrave; la cloche de bois</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> the nailing of one&#8217;s emptied
trunk to the floor to impress one&#8217;s <i>conci&egrave;rge</i> with its weight, the
paying of one&#8217;s rent by abstracting the clothes of one&#8217;s landlord
and putting them in pawn, and the grateful acceptance of the <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>,
chop, or sausage brought in by one&#8217;s pilfering dog, as if one were
Elijah and one&#8217;s <i>Toutou</i> were a raven of the wild, can hardly be
defended by any of the recognised bourgeois codes. But even
these flagrant escapades proceed less from malice than from mischief,
and even these fall strangely in line with equity in nine
cases out of ten.</p>

<p>On its Bohemian side, Montmartre is a second and, to the thinking
of many, a greater and more brilliant <i>Quartier Latin</i>.</p>

<p>Here abound the literary and artistic restaurants, caf&eacute;s, <i>bouillons</i>,
<i>cr&egrave;meries</i>, and cabarets which have always conferred a peculiar
charm on Paris. Here, as well as in the Latin Quarter (and more
numerous and varied, perhaps, here than there), are the modern
counterparts of the <i>Treille d&#8217;Or</i>, the <i>Pomme de Pin</i>, the <i>Radis
Couronn&eacute;</i>, the <i>Pressoir d&#8217;Or</i>, the <i>Ceinture qui Craque</i>, the <i>Deux
Torches</i>, and the <i>Trois Entonnoirs</i> of the time of Cyrano; the
<i>Procope</i>, <i>de Valois</i>, <i>de Foy</i>, <i>du Caveau</i>, and <i>M&eacute;canique</i> of the time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of Louis XVI.; the <i>Viot</i>, <i>Bl&eacute;ry</i>, <i>Flicoteaux</i>, <i>de Buci</i>, and <i>de la
Rotonde</i> of the Restoration and Louis Philippe; the <i>Moli&egrave;re</i>, <i>Voltaire</i>,
<i>L&#8217;Orient</i>, &#8220;<i>Sherry Cobbler</i>,&#8221; and <i>Bobino</i> of the last empire.
And here they have been long enough to have already developed
their legends and <i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">The cook at Margu&eacute;ry&#8217;s, being asked once upon a time what

<p>The line of boulevards extending from the Place de Clichy
to the Place d&#8217;Anvers which strikes American tourists, who visit
it for Montmartre, as a vulgar hodge-podge of Coney Island,
the Bowery, the Broadway of the Tenderloin, and South Fifth
Avenue, with a dash of, say, a Boston &#8220;Pop&#8221; concert on a Harvard
night, is no more the real Montmartre than Paris is the
real France. The real Montmartre is the abrupt hill known as
&#8220;The Butte,&#8221; just north of said boulevards<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and included between
them,&mdash;the rue Marcadet, the rue de Clignancourt, and the
avenue de St. Ouen, a section of which the gigantic Byzantine
cathedral of the <i>Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur</i>, the <i>Moulin de la Galette</i>, until recently
an unsophisticated popular ball, and the <i>cimeti&egrave;re de Montmartre</i>
(the second cemetery of Paris) are the salient features.</p>

<p>This real Montmartre (the Montmartre of the Butte) contains
a tiny local cemetery (long disused), a tiny twelfth-century parochial
church (St. Pierre), a tiny district theatre, a tiny village plaza
(Place du Tertre) with the customary trees, benches, and aged,
ruminating idlers, a tiny public park (Square St. Pierre), two
gaunt, grey windmills, and several sleepy wine-shops, over which
sleepy publicans preside. Here are five, six, and seven story city
buildings, to be sure, but here are also (particularly on the northern
slope) ancient garden-girdled mansions reminiscent of the
epoch when the whole district was open country; sculptured gate-posts,
crumbling, but stately, and rusty iron gates opening on
symmetrical avenues; small one-and-a-half-story tile-roofed and
straw-thatched dwellings, also garden-girdled, clutching with
the grip of the Swiss chalet the steep hillsides; narrow streets
and winding lanes, and worn stone stairways where the hill&#8217;s incline
forbids streets and lanes; high, erratic, heavily buttressed
stone walls, bulging with age, over which houses also bulging with
age (from the windows of which a Paul might be let down in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
basket) beetle as if to fall; diminutive fruit orchards and vegetable
gardens; and diminutive barnyards, cluttered with chicken-coops,
dove-cotes, pig-pens, and rabbit-cages, which advertise cows&#8217; and
goats&#8217; milk, compost, and young pigs for sale. Here cats and dogs
and hens roam multitudinous and unmolested, birds sing in the
shrubbery, and chanticleer proclaims the
dawn.</p>

<span class="captionc padr2"><i>two hundred miles from Paris.</i>&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>In sum, the Butte, the real Montmartre,
seems at first view to be one-half country
village and one-half large provincial town.
In the rue St. Vincent, the rue Mont-C&eacute;nis,
the rue des Saules, rue de la Fontaine-du-But,
rue de la Borne, rue St. Rustique, rue
Norvins, and rue de l&#8217;Abreuvoir, where one
is scarcely a twenty minutes&#8217; walk from the
Grands-Boulevards, one would believe himself
more than two hundred miles from the
metropolis,&mdash;so different are these streets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
from the average metropolitan ways,&mdash;were it not for the constant
outlooks on Paris spread out beneath one, for the large
proportion of Angoras among the ubiquitous cats, and the phenomenal
<i>savoir-vivre</i>, good-nature, and friendliness of the dogs;
were it not for an indefinable coquetry, tell-tale of Parisianism,
about the little garden-girdled houses and a hundred artistic
whimsicalities, such as are represented by a windmill studio and
a tram-car dwelling; were it not also that certain vistas are closed
by the flippant entrance to the <i>Moulin de la Galette</i>, that sundry
glimpses of studio interiors are vouchsafed, and that silhouettes
of long-haired, capering artists and of artists&#8217; models loom up
fitfully against the sky; and were there not a sort of vagabond
humour in the very atmosphere that accords ill with provincial
straight-lacedness.</p>

<p>As the Butte wears the general aspect of a provincial community,
so it has the provincial community&#8217;s spirit of neighbourliness;
but, as its provincial aspect is enlivened by coquetry and mirth,
so its provincial neighbourliness is happily modified by being
shorn of the meddling spirit. The <i>Montmartrois</i> is not indifferent
to the welfare of his fellow-<i>Montmartrois</i>; but he minds his own
business, which the neighbourly provincial rarely, if ever, does.
He is as willing as the most na&iuml;ve countryman to lend a helping
hand upon occasion; but, the occasion passed, he speedily effaces
himself. He does not feel entitled to enter into your intimacy,
to summer and winter with you, so to say, because he has done
you a casual good turn.</p>

<p>When I entered Montmartre, as most fellows enter it, with my
<i>lares and penates</i> enthroned on a hand-cart, and experienced the
difficulty other fellows, thus encumbered, have experienced in
scaling the Butte, a butcher&#8217;s boy and an artist who was sketching
in the street were prompt to put their shoulders to the wheel
(to the tail-board, to be strictly accurate); but they did not by the
same token cross-question me regarding my antecedents and intentions,
as countrymen, in the same circumstances, would have done.
They gracefully accepted my invitation to a social glass at an adjacent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
wine-shop, then went their ways to their respective tasks;
and that was the end of it.</p>

<p>The Butte, then, the real Montmartre, is in Paris, but not of it,
and yet, of necessity, perpetually conscious of it,&mdash;a community
which is and which is not a provincial town, which has an <i>esprit
de corps</i> not inconsistent with independence, a unity not destructive
of variety, and a sociability admirably accordant with a seemly
privacy; while the <i>Montmartrois</i> sees Paris without being blinded
by it, touches Paris without being crushed by it, and is stimulated
by Paris without losing his identity therein.</p>

<p class="tb">sings a <i>chansonnier</i> of Montmartre. And it is indeed this ability
to &#8220;be almost happy with nothing,&#8221; this fairy-godmother power
to transform by a simple flourish a pumpkin into a coach, a dowdy
into a fair princess, and a cabbage into a rose, this talent,
amounting to genius, for squeezing so very much more out of life
than there really is in it, that lifts completely out of the commonplace
the life of Montmartre.</p>

<p>For four hundred to five hundred francs a year, monsieur and
madame,&mdash;as in the Latin Quarter every Jack has his Jill, so on
the Butte every <i>Montmartrois</i> has his <i>Montmartroise</i>,&mdash;monsieur
and madame may have a <i>logement</i>,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> consisting of two or three
rooms and a kitchen with peerless views of Paris and the valley
of the Seine; and in the shops of the <i>brocanteurs</i> they may procure
antique furnishings of real beauty and durability, not, alas!
for the proverbial song, but for less than the bourgeois pay for
their ugly, up-to-date flimflams.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>Prices are dearer at Montmartre than in several other parts of
Paris. Nevertheless, there is no district where, day in and day
out, there is so much genuine poetry and so much honest zest
in living.</p>

<p>Louise France,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> a dramatic artist of vigorous talent, who has
been associated with nearly all the important literary movements of
Montmartre, is said to have welcomed a party of friends to her
modest <i>logement</i> one day with, &#8220;<i>Maintenant, en guise d&#8217;ap&eacute;ritif,
je vais vous offrir une vue splendide sur Paris: c&#8217;est tout ce que je
poss&egrave;de</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good Madame France is a thorough <i>Montmartroise</i>, and the
incident is admirably representative of the jocund humour of the
Butte. The <i>Montmartrois</i> will not only regale himself with a
view from a window in lieu of an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>, but he will merrily
substitute a <i>chanson</i> for a roast, console himself with a kiss for
the absence of the dessert, and warm himself, as my friend
L&mdash;&mdash;, who has not had a fire for three winters, expresses it, with
sunsets and tobacco smoke,&mdash;his own, if possible.</p>

<p>During the periods of moving (namely, the 1st to the 15th
of January, April, July, and October) the essential domesticity
of the Butte is amply and amusingly revealed, and the complete
congruity of domesticity and the arts is graphically demonstrated.</p>

<p>Chiffonniers lord it over model-thrones, paint brushes peep
over the rims of soup-kettles or hide their heads in coal-scuttles,
manikins fraternise with hat-trees and colour-boxes with stew-pans,
stretchers snuggle up to pillows, pastels and aquarelles lie cheek
by jowl with dish-towels and table-cloths, brooms pay court to
easels, palettes make eyes at feather dusters, and impressionistic
landscapes dazzle mirrors. Monsieur, aided by a chum, tugs a
precariously loaded hand-cart,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> or, if the distance to be traversed
makes the hand-cart unnecessary or a lack of funds makes it impossible,
he staggers, sweats, and swears under the weight of
trunks, chests, bureaus, and wardrobes; and madame, bareheaded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
in wrapper and slippers, proffers highly unwelcome caution and
advice while carrying the company coffee-cups or the parlour
lamp.</p>

<p>Like most other localities that partake of the idyllic, Montmartre
is most idyllic in the spring. Then painters work at their
easels in its streets, while their mesdames, who have followed them
forth with camp-chairs, sew and chatter in the nearest shade.
Then its poplars and limes are the same crisp, inviting green as
the salads that pass in the hand-barrows. Then its myriad lilac,
horse-chestnut, and acacia clusters are thyrsi awaiting the rhythmic
wavings of the bacchanals, and then its circumambient fragrance
would inflame a Hippolyta&#8217;s blood, trouble a Vestal&#8217;s
vows, and make a Diana&#8217;s senses reel. Then, too, models, posing
in court-yards and back gardens for the supernal effects of sunlight
on flesh, are like great pink-and-purple-dappled exotic blooms
escaped from Shelley&#8217;s pages.</p>

<p>The spirit of nature that with soft music is bursting the
bonds of winter, and the spirit of the artist, spontaneous, impulsive,
capricious, and free, are in absolute accord. One breathes
contempt for prudery and custom with the very air. Nature&#8217;s
upward-rushing sap and the artist&#8217;s careering fancy alike defy
repression.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Tout &ecirc;tre a le droit d&#8217;&ecirc;tre libre</i>,&#8221; the splendid throbbing lyric
climax of Charpentier&#8217;s Montmartre opera, <i>Louise</i>, had here its

<p class="quote">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Tout &ecirc;tre a le droit d&#8217;&ecirc;tre libre!</span>&#8221;&mdash;the careless attire,

suicide, return to their parents to
eat the fatted calf, become rich and famous
or alcoholic and insane, have one
other resource left them,&mdash;a resource beside
which the proverbial jump out of the
frying-pan into the fire is the quintessence
of discretion,&mdash;namely, emigration to
Montmartre.</p>

<p>Originally given over to windmills and
plaster ovens, a suburb at the time of the
Great Revolution (when it went for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
while by the name of Mont-Marat), Montmartre did not become
a part of Paris proper until 1859.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I knew Montmartre,&#8221; says one of its ardent admirers, &#8220;thirty-five
years ago. It was a quarter like another, less alive, in fact,
than most others, except in the immediate vicinity of the balls,
<i>le Grand Turc</i>, <i>la Boule Noire</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;All of a sudden the Haussmannising empire bound it to Paris
by the Boulevard Magenta, and the picks of the workmen have
had no respite since.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Eighteenth Arrondissement, which corresponds roughly
with Montmartre, has nearly doubled in population since the
Franco-Prussian war, and is now a city of more than 225,000
souls.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Travellers tell us,&#8221; wrote Aur&eacute;lien Scholl in 1898, &#8220;that in
America cities spring up with incredible rapidity.... I know only
two localities in France which have undergone a similar speedy
transformation,&mdash;Royan<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and Montmartre. It is not so very long
ago that we saw from the boulevards looking up the rue Laffitte
a verdant <i>butte</i> with a few windmills whose arms enlivened the
perspective. There were hovels and tiny, shabby-looking shops
along the present boulevards (Clichy and Rochechouart).</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Montmartre is to-day one of the finest cities of France. It
has three theatres, five or six <i>caf&eacute;s-concerts</i>, a circus, restaurants,
and <i>brasseries</i>.... <i>La cigale</i> sings there all summer&mdash;and all
winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the partial eyes of the loyal <i>Montmartrois</i>, Montmartre,
&#8220;<i>Ville Libre</i>,&#8221; literary and artistic Bohemia <i>par excellence</i>, is
as much the capital of Paris<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> as Paris is the capital of France.
To them all the rest of Paris, the Latin Quarter included, is merely
Montmartre&#8217;s back yard.</p>

<p>Montmartre, by reason of its surpassing view, has always been
favoured as a place of residence by detached writers and artists;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and, after the closing of the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Bobino</i> in the <i>Quartier Latin</i>,
a perceptible literary and artistic current thitherward set in. But
it was the exodus of the &#8220;<i>Hydropathes</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Hirsutes</i>&#8221; of the
<i>Quartier</i> to the <i>Chat Noir</i> that marked (marked rather than caused)
the real beginning of Montmartre&#8217;s supremacy.</p>

<p>The <i>Cercle des Hydropathes</i><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> owed its origin to one Charles
Cros, who, tiring of being relegated to an inglorious obscurity
while Coquelin <i>Cadet</i> won laurels by the recitation of monologues,
which he (Cros) had written, decided to recite his monologues
himself.</p>

<p>The first formal meeting of the <i>Hydropathes</i> was held on a
Friday of October, 1878, in a small upper room of a Latin Quarter
caf&eacute;, corner of the rue Cujas and the Boulevard St. Michel. There
were five persons present. At the next meeting there were seventy-five,
at the third one hundred, at the fourth one hundred and fifty,
and so on, until, driven from caf&eacute; to caf&eacute; by the need of more room,
they settled in a vacant store, with an average attendance of three
hundred to three hundred and fifty twice a week.</p>

<p>Emile Goudeau presided,&mdash;as nearly, that is, as any one can
be said to preside in a Latin Quarter assembly. There was liberty
to drink, smoke, and woo the <i>grisette</i>. There were folly
and tumult, confusion and fun; violin, piano, and guitar music;
singing in concert of riotous roof-lifting refrains; recitations of
novelties and the classics by Villain, Leloir, Le Bargy, and Coquelin
<i>Cadet</i> of the <i>Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise</i>. Paul Mounet, also of the
<i>Com&eacute;die</i>, arrayed in a blue blouse and red neckerchief, interpreted
<i>La Gr&egrave;ve des Forgerons</i> week in and week out with telling effect.
Maurice Rollinat sang his own songs and those of Pierre Dupont,
and recited selections from his <i>N&eacute;vroses</i> and <i>Brandes</i>. Laurent
Tailhade, Jean Mor&eacute;as, Georges d&#8217;Esparb&egrave;s, Louis Marsolleau,
Jean Ajalbert, Andr&eacute; Gill, L&eacute;on Valade, Charles Monselet, Paul
Marrot, Edmond Haraucourt, F&eacute;licien Champsaur, Mac-Nab,
Auguste Vacquerie, Louis Tiercelin, Alphonse Allais, Jules Jouy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and a full score more of poets and <i>chansonniers</i> rendered their works.
Bourget, Copp&eacute;e, Paul Ar&egrave;ne, Luigi Loir, and Bastien-Lepage
were frequent, though for the most part passive, spectators. All
degrees of talent, all shades of politics, and all of the poetic
schools were represented. Bernhardt was proud to be known as a
<i>Hydropathe</i>. Francisque Sarcey and Jules Claretie visited the
<i>Hydropathes</i>, and praised them in the press. The police threatened
to dissolve them, but wisely refrained.</p>

<p>The <i>Hirsutes</i> differed from the <i>Hydropathes</i> only in name and
in the fact that the name had an obvious significance.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Grand&#8217; Pinte</i> (a Louis XIII. cabaret of Montmartre,
frequented, but without mummery or fracas, by a band of painters
and poets) that gave Rodolphe Salis, an <i>ex-Hydropathe</i>, the idea of
putting the boisterous <i>Hydropathe</i> performances into a picturesque
setting and inviting the paying public to attend. Salis, who was
the son of a prosperous man of affairs, was in Bohemia against
his father&#8217;s wishes. Half-artist and half-litt&eacute;rateur, he supported
himself, when the paternal purse-strings were tightened,
by writing for the press and painting <i>Viae Dolorosae</i>
at fourteen francs apiece. In making himself &#8220;<i>gentilhomme-cabaretier</i>,&#8221;
as he called it, this resourceful Salis had hit upon
a device for reconciling theory with practice, filial submission
with personal inclination, and Bohemia with business, which,
to say the least, was not commonplace.</p>

<p>Salis&#8217; <i>Chat Noir</i>, &#8220;<i>Cabaret Moyen-Age fond&eacute; en 1114 par un
fumiste</i>,&#8221; was opened on the Boulevard de Rochechouart in
December, 1881; and the first number of its literary organ of the
same name, illustrated by Forain, Willette, Rochegrosse, Henri
Pille, Rivi&egrave;re, and Steinlen, was published the month following.
The cabaret&#8217;s bizarre frescos, contributed by the cleverest young
artists of Paris, and its fantastic furnishings of curios and antiques,
which Salis had zealously collected since his boyhood,
have been described too many times to be dwelt upon here. Suffice
it to say, the juxtaposition of the beautiful with the grotesque,
the serious with the flippant, and the reverent with the blasphemous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
was so ingenious and piquant that attempts to imitate
it (for the most part unsuccessful) have been made all over the
civilised world.</p>

<p>In this suggestive setting nearly the entire <i>personnel</i> of the
<i>Hydropathes</i> and a number of poets and dramatists, not <i>Hydropathes</i>,
who have since become celebrities, among them Georges
Court&eacute;line and Maurice Donnay, held witty carnival.</p>

<p>There was an even greater license of speech and act at the
<i>Chat Noir</i> than there had been among the <i>Hydropathes</i>. There
were also more all-night revels, more startling antitheses of the
lively and severe, and more practical joking. All this in spite of
the fact (or, perhaps, because of it) that the performers, almost
without exception, affected impassibility, maintaining a supernatural
gravity while dispensing the most side-splitting productions.</p>

<p>Salis&#8217; attempt to serve both God and Mammon resulted, as
such attempts have usually resulted, advantageously for Mammon.
Bohemia was reconciled to business by being completely
swallowed up by business. Salis, the <i>gentilhomme-cabaretier</i>,
waxed rich, and in waxing rich stooped to methods of holding
and dealing with his galaxy that have made his memory the execration
of the Butte. Nevertheless, Rodolphe Salis, all unworthy
Bohemian as his good fortune revealed him to be, gave Paris,
as impresario of the <i>Chat Noir</i>, a new manifestation of art and
did more than any one man towards establishing that modern republic
of arts and letters which is known as Montmartre.</p>

<p>The phenomenal success of the <i>Chat Noir</i>, whose fame from
being Parisian became European, naturally led to the opening of
establishments which copied one or more of its features. Montmartre
was soon honeycombed with <i>cabarets artistiques et litt&eacute;raires.</i></p>

<p>Steinlen, Willette, De Feure, Roedel, Redon, Toulouse-Lautrec,
Truchet, Bellanger, Le Petit, Gr&uuml;n, and other artists of the Butte,
especially the first three, were kept busy decorating; and the
most popular monologists and <i>chansonniers</i>,&mdash;Dominique Bonnaud,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Hugues Delorme, Jacques Ferny, Jules Jouy, E. Girault,
Eug&egrave;ne Lemercier, Camille Marceau, Georges Millandy, Marcel
Legay, Gaston Cout&eacute;, Paul Delmet, Th&eacute;odore Botrel, L&eacute;on
Dur&ocirc;cher, Vincent Hyspa, Yann Nibor, Maurice Boukay, Charles
Gallil&eacute;e, Jehan Rictus, Octave Pradels, Victor Meusy, Camille
Roy, Gabriel Montoya, Edmond Teulet, Paul Briand, Xavier
Privas, Raoul Ponchon, Fragson, Lef&egrave;vre, Xanrof, Perducet,
Dumestre, Mont&eacute;hus, Ivanof, Chatillon, Fursy, Canqueteau,
and Trimouillat,&mdash;most of whom had received a part of their training
at the <i>Chat Noir</i>,&mdash;performed regularly in two or three places
on the same evening.</p>

<p><i>La Grand&#8217; Pinte</i> (joint inspirer with the <i>Hydropathes</i> of the
<i>Chat Noir</i>) became under the direction of another Salis&mdash;Gabriel&mdash;the
<i>cabaret artistique et litt&eacute;raire, L&#8217;Ane Rouge</i>. Its next-door
neighbour, <i>Le Clou</i>, fitted itself out with a picturesque
second-story supper-room and an eccentric <i>caveau</i>, in which tourneys
of poetry were frequently given. <i>Le Caf&eacute; des D&eacute;cadents</i>
(later <i>Caf&eacute; Duclerc</i>, where the singers wore nooses about their
necks), with its &#8220;<i>Bruxellois Soupers</i>&#8221;; <i>Le Carillon</i>, with its &#8220;Assizes&#8221;;
<i>Le Fraternist&egrave;re</i>, with its &#8220;<i>Guignol Social</i>&#8221; and its &#8220;<i>chansons
et recr&eacute;ations sociologiques</i>&#8221;; <i>Le Casino des Conci&egrave;rges</i>, with
its &#8220;<i>Soupers Panamistes</i>&#8221;; <i>La Fourri&egrave;re</i> (The Pound), <i>La Roulotte</i>
(The Gypsy Van), <i>Le Cabaret des Assassins</i> (now <i>Le Lapin
Agile</i>), <i>Le Cabaret des Pommes-de-terre Frites</i>, <i>La Pur&eacute;e</i>, <i>La
Pur&eacute;e Sociale</i>, and the <i>Cabarets du Ciel, de l&#8217;Enfer</i>, and <i>du N&eacute;ant</i>,&mdash;had
each its little day of notoriety; and the last three, though
by all odds the flattest of the lot, are still run for the benefit of
country visitors.</p>

<p><i>Le Conservatoire</i> (whose specialty is the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre d&#8217;Ombres
Chinoises</i>&mdash;shadow pantomime&mdash;with which the subtle artist
Henri Rivi&egrave;re helped build up the vogue of Salis), <i>Le Cabaret
des Quat&#8217;z&#8217; Arts</i>, <i>Le Cabaret des Arts</i>, <i>La Veine</i>, and <i>La Lune
Rousse</i> are the five closest existing counterparts of the <i>Chat Noir</i>.
Their decorations are highly effective, and they employ most of the
<i>Chat Noir</i> celebrities who have not, like Salis, passed over to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
great majority.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> But their performances, while of high average
merit, are totally lacking in the elements of spontaneity and unexpectedness,
which constituted the rare and peculiar charm of the
programmes of the <i>Chat Noir</i> in its early and unspoiled days;
and their prices, which have increased in direct proportion as
intrinsic interest has decreased, are prohibitive for most of the real
Bohemians of Montmartre. The truth is, these cabarets have
long ceased to attract the <i>Montmartrois</i>, and are kept up as mere
show places for provincial and foreign tourists. It is only in their
front rooms, where prices are normal and no performances worth
mentioning are given&mdash;at the hour of the <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>, that one may
find any number of truly representative <i>Montmartrois</i>.</p>

<p>At <i>La Bo&icirc;te &agrave; Fursy</i> (in the building to which the <i>Chat Noir</i>
repaired when the complaints of its neighbours and the need of
more room forced it to quit its original home on the Boulevard
de Rochechouart) and <i>Le Tr&eacute;teau de Tabarin</i> (also under the management
of Fursy) the prices are still more prohibitive, so far
as Bohemia is concerned, and the audiences, by just so much the
more, unrepresentative.</p>

<p>All these places have been practically abandoned by their
former patrons, and by the unprofessional singing, rhyming, reciting
Bohemians in general, for tiny, obscure caf&eacute;s or wine-shops,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
whose tininess and obscurity are defences against sight-seeing
invasion, and for private ateliers, from which the uninvited may
be readily ejected. Those who, depressed by the professionalism,
mercenary spirit, and monotony of the best-known cabarets, declare
that the spirit of Bohemianism has abandoned the Butte,
do not take into account these multitudinous Bohemian conclaves,
of which they are, in all probability, totally ignorant.</p>

<p>One group, to which for two years the writer was privileged to
belong, included fifty members, whose ages ranged from twenty
to seventy and whose reputations ranged from zero to boulevard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
celebrity. It dined every Tuesday evening at a really cheap and
really Bohemian restaurant of the rue de la Rochefoucauld, adjourned
after dinner to the atelier of a musician in the rue Br&eacute;da
for literary and musical exercises mingled with horse-play, and
readjourned at midnight to the supper-room of an adjacent caf&eacute;
for unadulterated horse-play, without the slightest literary or
musical pretence.</p>

<p>In France the <i>chanson</i> is second only to the press (if, indeed,
it really be second to anything) as a moulder of public opinion.
It instructs less than the press, perhaps, but it excites more.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>chanson</i>, like the bayonet,&#8221; says Jules Claretie, &#8220;is a
French weapon.... We are afraid of the <i>chanson</i>. It is a dishevelled
personage who tells the truth. We exile it, we pursue it.
M. Javert pursued not otherwise Fantine.... We are afraid of
it because it is necessarily, fatally, of the opposition. It has no
reason for existence, if it is not factious.... From the <i>Mazarinades</i>
to the amusing <i>Chansons Rosses</i> of Fursy, the <i>chanson</i> has administered
fillips to the powers. It is its lot. I add, it is its right....
<i>Vive la chanson</i>! even the cruel <i>chanson</i>, when it is a sort of
Daumier!&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a small percentage of the songs heard in the <i>cabarets
artistiques et litt&eacute;raires</i> of Montmartre are frankly revolutionary
or even &#8220;of the opposition,&#8221; in the narrow partisan sense of that
phrase; but they nearly all &#8220;tell the truth to people,&#8221; they are
nearly all satirical and captious to the last degree&mdash;&#8220;of the opposition,&#8221;
that is, in the broader sense of the phrase. They assail
all the existing institutions,&mdash;army, state, church, property, and
marriage,&mdash;not with the direct invective which would put them
at the censorship&#8217;s mercy, but with the ridicule which in Paris,
as in perhaps no other spot on the globe, is more potent than invective,
and before which the censorship, though it turn pale
and tear its hair with rage, is powerless.</p>

<p>Jules Jouy,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> one of the bright particular stars of the <i>Chat
Noir</i> and of several of its successors and imitators, was at once a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
veritable Gavroche for saucy wit and a fervent pleader for the
poor. He was a regular contributor to several socialistic sheets;
and his <i>Chansons de Bataille</i>&mdash;<i>La Terre</i>, <i>Les Enfants et les M&egrave;res</i>,
<i>La Veuve</i>, <i>Fille d&#8217;Ouvrier</i>, <i>Les Inconnus</i>, <i>La Gr&egrave;ve Noire</i>, <i>P&acirc;le
Travailleur</i>, <i>Victimes du Travail</i>, <i>Le Sang des Martyrs</i>, <i>La Carmagnole
des Meurts-de-Faim</i>, etc.&mdash;are superb examples of the
chanson of social revolt and reclamation.</p>

<p>The manager of the <i>Casino des Conci&egrave;rges</i>, <i>Le Cabaret des
Pommes-de-terre Frites</i>, and <i>La Pur&eacute;e Sociale</i>, was an ancient revolutionist,
Maxime Lisbonne, who had distinguished himself
on a barricade of the Place du Panth&eacute;on during the Commune.</p>

<p>In the supper-rooms of the <i>Clou</i> the anarchist poet Paul Paillette
was wont to recite his anarchist poems, and the <i>Clou</i> is still
a favourite meeting-place for revolutionary groups.</p>

<p>At the <i>Quat&#8217;z&#8217; Arts</i> Marcel Legay varies his r&eacute;pertoire of
sentimental and patriotic ballads with the stirring revolutionary
<i>chansons</i> of Maurice Boukay and J. B. Cl&eacute;ment; Gaston Cout&eacute;
recites his subversive &#8220;<i>Les Conscrits</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Le Christ en Bois</i>&#8221;;
Eug&egrave;ne Lemercier with genial malice, Gaston S&eacute;cot with waggery,
and Yon Lug with Chinese imperturbability ridicule officialism
in its every phase; Xavier Privas (Prince of <i>Chansonniers</i> by
formal election), in his highly individual and snappy fashion,
renders&mdash;between two idyls&mdash;his fine socialistic song <i>Les R&eacute;sign&eacute;s</i>
or exalts poverty with his <i>No&euml;l</i> or <i>Testament de Pierrot</i>; and
Jehan Rictus intones his heart-breaking <i>Soliloques du Pauvre</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Quat&#8217;z&#8217; Arts</i> has also had courses of Sunday afternoon
lectures on the <i>chanson</i> by the socialist deputies Clovis Hugues
and Maurice Boukay.</p>

<p>The <i>Bo&icirc;te &agrave; Fursy</i>, though catering palpably to the snobs,
is shut up nearly every season by an irate censorship, and this
more often for reasons of politics than from any consideration of
public morality.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I have been allowed this merit, and it is the sole one I claim,&#8221;
says Fursy, in the introduction to his <i>Chansons Rosses</i>, &#8220;of never
letting pass, or rarely letting pass, a salient happening without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
singing it immediately, and attempting to draw from it, in a refrain,
the morality&mdash;or immorality&mdash;which the worthy man called
<i>Monsieur Tout-le-Monde</i> assigns it in his talk. I do my utmost
not to lose time, and to serve actuality piping hot. I am really
satisfied only when I manage to sing, in the evening, couplets
inspired by that morning&#8217;s event; and I have had the luck
almost always to succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the <i>Cabarets du Ciel</i>, <i>de l&#8217;Enfer</i>, and <i>du N&eacute;ant</i>&mdash;which,
being mainly dependent for their effects upon machinery, hardly

belong at all in the class of <i>caf&eacute;s artistiques
et litt&eacute;raires</i>&mdash;have, lurking under all their
vulgar clap-trap, no small fund of pungent
satire on religion and the church.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Finally, there are at Montmartre a round
half-dozen resorts, <i>cabarets de la
chanson d&#8217;argot</i> (also called <i>cabarets
brutaux</i>), of which Bruant&#8217;s
<i>Mirliton</i>, Alexandre&#8217;s <i>Cabaret
Bruyant</i>, and &#8220;Buffalo&#8217;s&#8221; <i>l&#8217;Alouette</i>
are the most conspicuous examples.
They have had their day
so far as spontaneity is concerned,
like the <i>cabarets artistiques et litt&eacute;raires</i>,
though, like them, they
still attract foreigners and provincials.</p>

<p>Mercenary and meretricious now
to the last degree, however genuine
they may have been in the
beginning, they still have this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
much, at least, of sincerity,&mdash;namely, cordial detestation of the
bourgeois; and it is to this very spirit, strangely enough, that
their vogue with the bourgeois has been due.</p>

<p>It was of one of these <i>cabarets brutaux</i> (Bruant&#8217;s <i>Mirliton</i>,
probably) that Zola wrote in <i>Paris</i>: &#8220;Pleasure-seeking Paris, the
<i>Bourgeoisie</i>, mistress of money and of power, sickened by their
possessions in time, but unwilling to let anything go, flocked
thither&mdash;to receive insults and obscenities full in the face.... Far
more than in the words, the burning insult was in the manner
with which the singer cast the words in the teeth of the rich,
of the favoured, of the fine ladies who elbowed each other to hear
him. Under the low ceiling, amid the smoke of pipes, in the
blinding heat of the gas, he launched his verses brutally like
<i>crachats</i>, a very hail-squall of furious contempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruant himself rarely appears nowadays at his <i>Mirliton</i>, which,
with the aid of under-studies, he, nevertheless, keeps up. Loaded
with notoriety and wealth, he has come to prefer following the
hounds or emptying a bottle of good wine, as the Ch&acirc;telain of
Courthenay, to entertaining the bourgeois by affronting them.</p>

<p>Not long back Bruant was an unsuccessful candidate for
deputy at Belleville, which adjoins Montmartre. His address
to his electors&mdash;with which it is customary for candidates to placard
the walls of their districts&mdash;was in rhyme. The verses,
though not of his best, are novel enough to demand quotation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bruant&#8217;s <i>Mirliton</i>, thanks to the forceful talent of its founder,
its lugubrious but artistic furnishings, and its cavalier treatment
of its patrons, is the most famous, the most picturesque, and the
most startling of the <i>cabarets brutaux</i>.</p>

<p>Alexandre owes such success as he has had at the <i>Cabaret
Bruyant</i> less to his talent as a writer and singer of <i>chansons</i>, which
is not great, than to his having sung in the streets with Mme.
Eug&eacute;nie Buffet for the benefit of the poor<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> (his cabaret is also
known as <i>Le Cabaret du Chanteur des Cours</i>) and to his having
been haled into court by Bruant for plagiarising his costume.
The court decided in this <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> (Bruant <i>vs.</i> Alexandre)
that the top-boots, velvet jacket, scarlet scarf, and mountaineer&#8217;s
felt which Bruant wore professionally were his trade-mark,
so to speak, and that the professional costume adopted by Alexandre&mdash;which,
without being an exact copy, was as close a copy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
as the word &#8220;Bruyant,&#8221; for example, is of Bruant&mdash;constituted
a palpable infringement. And it granted Bruant an injunction
restraining Alexandre from appearing therein. The judgment
was reaffirmed upon appeal.</p>

<p>In his first burst of rage over the result, Alexandre threatened
to sing without any costume whatsoever; but he thought better
of that. What he did do was to defy the court. Swearing

<span class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="f294" id="f294"></a><img src="images/f294.png" width="250" height="484"

<span class="captionc">ALEXANDRE</span></span>

there was not force enough in
France to undress him, he persisted
in wearing the prohibited
garb.</p>

<p>These strained relations with the
law of the land made a hero of
Alexandre, in a small way. He
became thus a sort of Jules
Gu&eacute;rin, and his cabaret a sort of
Fort Chabrol. He elucidated the
situation to his audiences nightly
in a speech that ran somewhat
like this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;What do you say to a republic
where you can&#8217;t wear, so that they
be decent, any clothes you like?
This business has cost me more
than ten thousand francs already.
Every day&mdash;and  it&#8217;s seventeen
months now it&#8217;s been going on&mdash;the
sheriff appears. &#8216;Still in the
costume, Alexandre?&#8217; And that
means twenty francs!  Twenty
francs a day&mdash;to say
nothing of the costs&mdash;counts
up. Well, what
of it? Let the bill swell!
Let them come as often
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
as they please! It&#8217;s their right! But I keep on wearing the
clothes all the same.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Not that I don&#8217;t recognise in Bruant, for all the harm he&#8217;s
trying to do me, my <i>cher ma&icirc;tre</i>. What should I be without
him? Nothing at all. Oh, yes, I&#8217;m ready enough to admit
that. I am no ingrate. For the man who is ruining me, I have
something <i>there</i>, at the heart, which abides, and which nothing
can take away.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;When I began to wear the costume, Aristide didn&#8217;t object.
Not he. He thought me beneath his notice, I suppose. But,
when he sees I am succeeding, then he brings me up in court.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The truth of it is, he dreads my competition. I frighten him.
My glory throws him in the shade. He says to Alexandre, &#8216;Get
out of my light!&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The Law has smitten me in the name of Bruant: the Law does
not know me. Since I have sung, I have gleaned upon the public
places, in the streets, twenty-two thousand francs for the poor;
and I am ordered to strip off my trousers. There&#8217;s justice for
you!</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Now on with the music! Twenty francs to pay every time
I dare to don the forbidden costume, the costume Bruant. It&#8217;s
cheap at twenty francs. I don the costume, and I pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The law is effective, it would seem, in preventing Alexandre
from appearing publicly in the costume outside of his own
cabaret.</p>

<p>Out of the medley of monologists and <i>chansonniers</i> (largely,
of course, made up of mediocrities) who practise their professions
in the cabarets of Montmartre, several of genuine poetical
talent have emerged; and, of these, at least three are characterised
by a thoroughly lawless or revolutionary spirit. These
three are: Aristide Bruant, who exhibits a reality, a virility, a
brutality, a grim humour, a picturesqueness of epithet, a boldness
of imagery, and a tragic quality in caricature which make
him (in a narrow field) a sort of French Kipling, with an honest
devil-may-care quality by the side of which Kipling&#8217;s bravado
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
seems fustian; Jehan Rictus, less facile, less humorous, and
less insolent than Bruant, but his equal in realism and his superior
in sentiment; and Maurice Boukay (retired, and now a deputy),
who lacks the grip on reality of Bruant and Rictus, but who atones
partially for this lack by a wealth of stirring appeal.</p>

<p>Boukay&#8217;s point of view is that of the <i>lettr&eacute;</i>, the social philosopher,
the reformer, the enlightened friend of the poor. His
words are words of faith, trumpet-calls from the heights instead
of gibes or moans from the depths. They ring true of reasoned
and righteous revolt. His <i>Chansons Rouges</i> are neither narrative
nor descriptive; not <i>chansons v&eacute;cues</i>,&mdash;that is, <i>chansons</i>
based on his own experience,&mdash;but symbolic poems,&mdash;symbolic
in both language and thought, what he himself might call &#8220;<i>chansons
d&#8217;humanit&eacute; multiple et objective</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;They were all written,&#8221; says M. Boukay in his introduction,
&#8220;in a complete independence of spirit, at a time when, not yet
having entered political life, I listened to the great voice of the
people, and endeavoured to seize its hidden meaning.... My
master Verlaine said: &#8216;The <i>chanson</i> of love is blue. The <i>chanson</i>
of dreams is white. The <i>chanson</i> of sadness is grey.&#8217; The <i>chanson
sociale</i> is red.... It is the colour of the glass of wine that your
good heart offers the vagrant to comfort him on the high road
of life. It is the colour of the rising sun towards which your ardent,
hopeful eyes yearn. It is the most intense hue of the tricolor
flag, which lies close to the heart of all the miseries, which waves
in the wind of all the liberties.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Stop there!&#8217; exclaims some timorous spirit. &#8216;Do you not
fear, singer of fraternity, to deepen the regrets and inflame the
anguish of the people under pretext of describing them?&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But, my good critic, will voicing the plaint of him who travails
and suffers, always, then, be to wound the sanctimonious
egoisms of him who digests and does nothing else? Would
you resemble the iniquitous rich man,&mdash;tolerate the stretching
forth of the hand, silent and ashamed, to beg, and forbid the quivering
lips to groan? If you do not hear the groan, how can you

<p>There is not a character of the Paris underworld nor a phase
of its life about which Bruant has not cast the glamour of his
suggestive <i>argot</i>: beggars and vagabonds; semi-vagabond acrobats,
rag-pickers, and sandwich-men; thieves, thugs, <i>maquereaux</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
and murderers; foundlings and the lowest grades of prostitutes,
a veritable Maxim Gorky galaxy; starving, shivering, loafing,
sinning, and suffering men and women; attractive sloth, picturesque
horror, piquant degradation and savoury crime,&mdash;all in a lurid
setting of teeming faubourg streets, public balls, all-night restaurants,
bagnios, prisons, and the guillotine!</p>

rouse the common people against
the army than all the anti-militarist
meetings of the socialists and anarchists
combined. But propriety,
alas! forbids their presence&mdash;and
the presence of most of the best
of Bruant&#8217;s work in this volume.</p>

<p>The monologues of Jehan Rictus
(<i>Soliloques du Pauvre</i>, <i>Dol&eacute;ances</i>,
and <i>Cantil&egrave;nes du Malheur</i>) are conspicuous
among the poems of poverty
for their absolute and abject
despair. Jehan Rictus is a man
who has done many kinds of hard
manual labour, if report speaks
true, and who knows the wretchedness
of extreme penury by long and
cruel experience. &#8220;A strange and
highly typical figure; a pale, emaciated
head we seem to have
seen somewhere before. Where?&mdash;in
church paintings, perhaps; sad,
lean, narrow-chested, tall, &#8216;long as
a tear,&#8217; and an expression so weary!
He does not essay a gesture. He
has only his voice, the anguish of
his face, and the feverish gleam of
his eyes with which to move us.
His hands, held always behind him,
twitch ineffectually as if trying to
burst invisible bonds.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>In portraying the physical discomforts of poverty, the racking
coughs, raging thirsts, aching bones, the nights without shelter
or sleep, the days without food, the tears that scald and the tearlessness
that deadens, Jehan Rictus has only done what has been
done a score of times in prose and verse. Surely, an empty heart
keeps close company, more often than not, with an empty stomach,
and it is in portraying vividly the mental and spiritual aspects
of poverty that his work is fresh and unique. The humiliation
of poverty&#8217;s uniform,&mdash;unkempt hair, missing shirt, drafty
shoes, outlandish and threadbare garments,&mdash;of the pavement
bed, of the paroxysms of hunger attributed to intoxication, of the
unsuccessful search for work, of debarment from places of public
resort, of silent submission to insult and gibe; the disgust with filth,
vermin, vulgar noise, endless monotony, enforced celibacy, patronising
pity, petty deceits improvised to hide destitution, and
hilarity improvised to keep back tears; the hatred of those who
practise injustice and hypocrisy; the scorn of those who bestow
and those who accept charity; the incipient madness of starvation,
at once impelling to a shedding of the blood of the guilty
and raising a horrid dread of confounding the innocent with the
guilty; the regret for loss of respectability, courage, ambition,
energy, talent, faith; the oppressive lonesomeness; the yearning
for fresh distractions, innocent joys, cleanly living, for kindly
words, sympathetic hand-clasps, kisses, caresses, companionship,
friendship, love, precious responsibility; the stolid indifference
to death,&mdash;all these, the underlying sentiments of poverty, have
never before been given in poetry, at least not without the blight
of palpable literary effort or factitious emotionalism.</p>

<p>Equally unique and equally powerful with the exhibition of the
multiform woes of the destitute is the poet&#8217;s satirical exposure of
the inconsistencies, insincerities, vanities, and refined cruelties of the
various sorts of people who exploit the destitute. With an ironical
pretence of rendering deserved homage to poverty, he elaborates
the important part it plays in the social scheme. Thanks to it,
the employees of the <i>Assistance Publique</i> are able to maintain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
their families in comfort; magistrates to attain a rotund and tranquil
old age; economists (deferring to it as a dignified entity)
to win professional chairs and academic honours; politicians to
get the public ear; socialistic and anarchistic bawlers to finish
out their careers as dawdling, alcoholic deputies; poets, painters,
and novelists to swim in glory and good wine, and found luxurious
establishments for their offspring.</p>

<p>The arrival of winter, which clots the blood of one class, stimulates
the circulation of all the others. Then reputable benevolence
drums a r&eacute;veille on hollow stomachs; burial companies
wax radiantly bustling; salons, languishing for want of something
to talk about, revive promptly; the tourist in the Midi and the
bourgeois, smug and snug by his fireside, daily commiserate
suffering&mdash;after dinner&mdash;in a manner both magnificent and
ample; society gambols at charity f&ecirc;tes and balls; the press &#8220;rediscovers
distress&#8221;; journalists sob, weep, and implore&mdash;at three
sous a line. In a word, pitying the unfortunate is a profession
like another; and, if the day should ever arrive when there were
no more poor in the world, &#8220;many people&#8221;&mdash;to render idiom
for idiom&mdash;&#8220;would be badly in the soup.&#8221; Such satire stings
and routs by virtue of the moral force behind it: it is the whip
of small cords plied by the man with a soul.</p>

<p>Satire broadens to rollicking humour in depicting the abject
terror of a conscience-stricken bourgeois shopkeeper before the
embarrassing spectre of a hungry man:&mdash;</p>

<p>I laughed almost to tears when I came upon this picture, because
I knew that same bourgeois shopkeeper&mdash;in Boston&mdash;during
the historic famine winter of 1893-94, when a great press
formed a syndicate for the dissemination of lies, when the authority
of a great state was appealed to, and a great governor
received congratulatory despatches from the confines of a great
country for prompt and decisive action in a great emergency,
and all because a few half-starved devils took a notion to show
themselves without washing their hands and faces or changing
their clothes.</p>

<p>But to return to France. Jehan Rictus loves the white apparitions
of the &#8220;first communicants,&#8221; loves sunshine, lilacs,
and watercress, birds and little children. Mrs. Browning&#8217;s
memorable &#8220;Cry of the Children&#8221; is feeble and conventional
by the side of his &#8220;<i>Farandole des Pauv&#8217;s &#8216;tits Fan-Fans</i>.&#8221; Charles
Lamb was not sweeter, tenderer, daintier, in his tear-compelling
reverie, &#8220;Dream Children,&#8221; than Rictus in dealing with his dream
loves,&mdash;his &#8220;cemetery of innocents&#8221; he calls them, his &#8220;poor little
heap of dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>His &#8220;<i>Espoir</i>,&#8221; in which he dreams of a sweetheart, is a veritable
Eug&egrave;ne Carri&egrave;re in verse.</p>

<p>Another poem containing much of the same sad, tender beauty,
strangely commingled with piquant malice, mischievous <i>esprit</i>,
broad humour, and bitter satire; a poem which, in spite of startling
liberties of vocabulary, rhythm, and rhyme, is said to have
brought honest tears to the eyes of the impeccable De H&eacute;r&eacute;dia,
is &#8220;<i>Le Revenant</i>.&#8221; The &#8220;<i>Revenant</i>&#8221; is Jesus Christ. The appearance
of Christ in nineteenth-century Paris is a much-worn
<i>motif</i> in French literature and painting; but the slum poet&#8217;s
handling of it is so new, bold, and strong that it seems to be
altogether fresh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Le Revenant</i>&#8221; is in three parts.</p>

<p>Part I. is a query as to what would happen if Jesus Christ
should come back, and introduces a summary of the principal
events of his career and a strikingly original appreciation of his
personality and character. He is the &#8220;man of the beautiful
eyes and the beautiful dreams, whose heart was larger than life.&#8221;
But he is also &#8220;the anarchist,&#8221; the &#8220;Galilean tramp,&#8221; the &#8220;carpenter
on a strike,&#8221; the &#8220;boon companion of thieves,&#8221; the &#8220;quack
hated by the doctors,&#8221; the &#8220;duffer who wore another cross than
that of the Legion of Honour, who boxed the bourgeois shop-keepers,
and who wasn&#8217;t over-polite to the muffs of his time,&#8221;&mdash;phrases
through whose vulgar, uncouth, seemingly sacrilegious
envelope are plainly visible intense love and admiration, and
which accurately represent the religious attitude of the submerged,
who, proverbially, applaud the name of Christ while
they hiss the barest mention of his professed followers and his
church.</p>

<p>In Part II. Jesus Christ suddenly appears on a corner of one
of the exterior boulevards. The surprised poet greets him with
bluff good-nature, laments drolly his inability to do the proper
thing by him in the matter of drinks, and overwhelms him with
eager, na&iuml;ve questions. Then, touched to the heart by his dazed
look and apparent helplessness, he assumes a kindly superiority,
taking him under his protection, as he might a lost infant,
warning him against many things, especially against the police,
who will be certain to arrest him as a vagabond if he
falls within their view. Finally, he discovers that the figure
he has taken to be that of the Christ is his own figure mirrored
in the window of the wine-shop before which he has been
standing.</p>

<p>Part III. is the after-thought, what the poet would most wish
to have said to Jesus Christ if he really had returned and he had
been the first to greet him. Necessarily a repetition at many
points of Parts I. and II., its excuse is the following declaration
of faith:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was probably this downright and direct threat that led
Jules Claretie, writing for <i>Le Temps</i>, to say: &#8220;The poetry of the
lean Jehan Rictus is the Fronde of to-day. Far better that it
mutter in the cabaret than in the street.&#8221; The majority of the
press critics, ignoring this single unequivocal threat and numerous
indirect but slightly veiled anathemas, have pronounced
his work &#8220;gentle and refined.&#8221; Both interpretations are, in a
measure, right.</p>

<p>Desiring revolt with his whole soul, and sure of the righteousness
of it, he is likewise so sure of its entire uselessness that
he deprecates it far oftener than he proclaims it. A better state
of things, in even the most distant future, is to him but a dubious
&#8220;perhaps.&#8221; From kings, presidents, councils, parliaments, nobles,
bourgeois, popes, priests, economists, reformers, and philanthropists
he expects nothing. From his own down-trodden
class he expects no more. They are stupid cattle, waiting patiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
to be bled. Enfeebled by hardship, cowed into spiritlessness
by police and magistrates, ready to share with the dogs
the crumbs that drop from rich men&#8217;s tables, to cringe and fawn
before the faintest prospect of a bone; ready to sell themselves
outright for two bars of music, three sous of absinthe, or a
couple of rounds of tobacco; blinded by the dazzling fiction of
universal suffrage: they are only fit, at the moment a Bastille
ought to be taken, to take the tram-car of that name, and generally
show more signs of reverting to the type of the ourang-outang
than of ushering in that era of universal affection, when
all men will be as brothers, and all nations of one speech and
one mind.</p>

<p>His prayers are despairing cries to a half-credited God,&mdash;a
God at best so old, deaf, blind, unconcerned, and far away that
his interference is not much to be counted on.</p>

<p>He conjures Jesus Christ into the world only to chaff him for
his faith in man, to characterise his teachings as the beautiful
soliloquies of an unfortunate, and, finally, to warn him to make
good his escape, if he would keep out of the clutches of nineteenth-century
Judas Iscariots and Pontius Pilates.</p>

<p>The prophets and teachers who have tried radically to better
the world have always been treated as criminals, and always will
be. It is vain to struggle to make things over. Man is a muff
by nature, and nature will never change. The kilogramme of
iron falsely called a heart will never be anything more than a
kilogramme of iron. The bank of love &#8220;assigned&#8221; centuries
ago. Modern civilisation is organised distress. These are his
sober and reasoned conclusions.</p>

<p>But ever and anon, when pain grows too great to be borne,
the blind instinct of self-preservation overtops reason. Then
he swears to be his &#8220;own good God all alone,&#8221; taking &#8220;his own
skin for a banner, since that is the only thing he has in the world.&#8221;
Even so his words are less the rallying cry of a reformer who believes
in success than the desperate defiance of a Prometheus
chained to a rock; and recoil is speedy to his habitual sentiment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
reiterated so often as to be a veritable refrain, &#8220;It&#8217;s only life, after
all: there&#8217;s nothing to do but to weep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jehan Rictus,&#8221; said a writer in the <i>Gil Blas</i>, &#8220;has definitely
fixed a new poetic sob in the cacophony of eternal human suffering.&#8221;
Needless to add, a sob was not his choice. Fate chose
for him. His is no case of &#8220;wilful sadness in literature.&#8221; Sweet,
tender, affectionate by nature, enamoured of sunlight, he might,
under happier conditions, have given a smile, a cheer, a p&aelig;an
even, to the world. In giving a sob, he gave what life gave him,&mdash;his
all.</p>

<p>He is the perfect nihilist, who fails to be the perfect anarchist
only because he has no faith. His Paris underworld is an Inferno.
&#8220;All hope abandon ye who enter here,&#8221; is the burden
of his message from the submerged; and it is this, probably, that
led Laurent Tailhade to call him &#8220;the Dante of <i>la mis&egrave;re</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jehan Rictus is at present preaching his gospel of blended
defiance and despair in prose, in a journal called <i>L&#8217;Ennemi du
Peuple</i>. His journalism, however, rises very little above the
commonplace. He is growing fat and fashionable, and it is to be
feared that his days of significant poetical productiveness are
over.</p>

<p>Montmartre participated actively in the revolution of 1830,
and was the seat of the <i>Club de la Montagne</i> in that of 1848. Of
the period immediately preceding the Commune one of its old
residents writes: &#8220;There, insurrection held its drums and its guns
always ready. The right to live free was the most precious of
all things to the hearts of all.&#8221; It seems to have been the order
to seize the cannons which the <i>Gardes Nationaux</i> had transported
to Montmartre after the capitulation of Paris that precipitated
the Commune; and it was at Montmartre that the generals Lecomte
and Cl&eacute;ment Thomas were executed.</p>

<p>Louise Michel&mdash;and who should know better?&mdash;in her fascinating
<i>M&eacute;moires</i> testifies to the revolutionary prestige of Montmartre.
She says, referring to the siege of Paris:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The Eighteenth Arrondissement was the terror of the selfish,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
plundering jobbers, and others of their breed. When it was
rumoured, &#8216;Montmartre is coming down&#8217; (&#8216;<i>Montmartre va descendre</i>&#8217;),
the reactionaries scampered to their holes like hunted
animals, deserting in their panic the secret storehouses in which
provisions were rotting while Paris was starving to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, apropos of her discharge from custody in the early part
of the insurrection, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The four <i>citoyens</i>, Th. Ferr&eacute;, Avronsart, Burlot, and Christ,
came to demand my release in the name of the Eighteenth Arrondissement.
At the first word of this phrase,&mdash;terror of the
reaction,&mdash;&#8216;Montmartre is coming down,&#8217; I was given into their
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still again, in a letter to Rochefort and Pain, on her return
from exile:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I am writing to Joffrin at the same time as to you on the subject
of the meeting of Montmartre, before which I cannot go to
any other. It was at Montmartre I marched formerly: it is with
Montmartre I march to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was to the Montmartre of the <i>indig&egrave;nes</i>, the Montmartre
of the workingmen, the Montmartre then regarded as a twin of
Belleville, which was known as le <i>crat&egrave;re de la r&eacute;volution</i>, that
Louise Michel paid these tributes of affection and esteem. The
invasion of the hordes of arts and letters, who hold the <i>Vache
Enrag&eacute;e</i> above the Golden Calf, far from weakening the revolutionary
fervour of the Butte, has strengthened it. Montmartre is
none the less a hot-bed of revolution for having become a shrine
of the Muses. On the contrary, its present revolutionary spirit
is the spirit of the old Montmartre and of the new Bohemia fused
into one; and it makes the &#8220;selfish, plundering jobbers, and others
of their breed,&#8221; quake more than ever.</p>

<p>At every cloud on the municipal horizon no bigger than a
man&#8217;s hand, at every suggestion of disturbance in the political
atmosphere, at every slightest rumble presaging the rising of the
masses, the classes peer nervously and timorously in the direction
of the beetling Montmartre, regretting from the bottom of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
their hearts that the offer Rothschild is said to have once made,
to raze the Butte at his own expense, was not accepted by the
government.</p>

<p>The relations between the aboriginal workingmen and the
artistic and literary colonists of Montmartre are of the most
cordial sort. There is a genuine solidarity between them (wherein
is a profound lesson for the social settler), because they have
common sufferings, common hatreds, common apprehensions,
and common hopes; because they faint from the same hunger,
shiver from the same frost, dread the same rent-bills, are liable
to the same evictions and the same police <i>rafles</i>, and are under
the same temptation, when houseless, to commit a petty misdemeanour
in order to get stowed away for the night.</p>

<p>Artists may help the poor working people about them&mdash;without
that effort of will, that compulsion of duty, which inevitably
involves patronage, and which is the bane of all the attempts
of the well-to-do to &#8220;elevate&#8221; the poor&mdash;because, poor themselves,
they often accept help from them in return and <i>in kind</i>, and
because they are neither mysteries nor objects of envy to any.</p>

<p>Nowhere in Paris, certainly, is the identity of interests and
sentiments of the simple proletariat and the <i>prol&eacute;tariat litt&eacute;raire</i>
so graphically presented and the much-prated alliance between
brain and brawn, labour and intellect, so completely realised. Nowhere
this side of heaven, probably, is social democracy so real
and so devoid of pose.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that these poor devils of painters and
poets, ardent-eyed and beauty-loving, are inwardly submissive
because they rail outwardly at their misfortunes; that they pardon
either the individuals who victimise them or the society which
allows individuals to victimise them. Revolt is none the less
revolt for perpetrating and relishing a joke.</p>

<p>The note of social revolt in the cavalcade of the <i>Vache Enrag&eacute;e</i>
and in the mock ceremony of the marriage of the <i>Rosi&egrave;re</i>; in the
more than unconventional daily life, with its contemptuous disregard
of ordinances of state and sacraments of church; in the political
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
and social satire of the <i>chansonniers</i>, who sing indifferently
in the <i>soir&eacute;es</i> of the socialist and anarchist groups and in the <i>cabarets
artistiques et litt&eacute;raires</i>; and in the coarse derision of the bawlers
of the <i>cabarets brutaux</i>,&mdash;is not to be ignored on the ground that
it bears a semblance of mirth. The child&#8217;s play theory is absolutely
untenable in this connection. These jolly Bohemian dogs
of Montmartre are capable of corroding rancours and terrible
wrath. And, if that descent from Montmartre which the conscience-stricken
bourgeois feel in their bones will come, ever does
come, it will not be the simple proletariat that will inaugurate
and lead it, but the rollicking <i>prol&eacute;tariat litt&eacute;raire</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HATEVER may be the verdict of posterity regarding
the literary and philosophical activity of this restless,
problematic period, the verdict of the contemporary
world seems to be that Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Zola are the three
biggest literary philosophers (or philosophical litt&eacute;rateurs) of their
day and generation; and it is a noteworthy fact, to put it mildly,
that the attitude towards society of each one of these three intellectual
giants is, more or less openly, revolutionary. All three
may be claimed by the parties of revolt without any considerable
forcing of the note.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, by reason of his adoration of Jesus, his insistence on
a literal interpretation of Jesus&#8217; teachings, his advocacy of non-resistance
as the most effective form of resistance, and his attempts
to incorporate liberty in education and, by education, in
life, seems to fall naturally enough into the category of the &#8220;Christian
anarchist.&#8221; But, whether Tolstoy be a &#8220;Christian anarchist&#8221;
or a &#8220;Christian socialist,&#8221; as certain Christian socialists rather
presumptuously claim, is immaterial. He is opposed to the established
order, and belongs indisputably with the revolutionists.</p>

<p>Ibsen is a fearless, implacable, self-confessed destroyer of
dogma and tradition, whom the anarchists may claim without
doing violence either to themselves or to him.</p>

<p>The attitude of Zola towards society and the social problem
is not so easy to define.</p>

<p>Zola exposed with a frankness bordering on brutality the rottenness
of the wealthy and privileged classes, the oppressions
and cruelty of capital, the selfishness and hypocrisy of ministers,
magistrates, army officers, and priests; pictured with a friendliness
bordering on advocacy the sufferings and struggles of the
labourers, and stated with perfect fairness the most revolutionary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
ideas and ideals. That he had in him little enough of the stuff
of which real martyrs are made&mdash;in spite of his constitutional
inability to &#8220;shut himself up in his works, and act only through
them,&#8221; as he a hundred times announced his intention of doing&mdash;was
shown clearly enough by his ignominious flight when
things turned against him in the Dreyfus affair. Nevertheless,
no novelist of his time&mdash;at least none in France&mdash;has portrayed
so masterfully, so sympathetically, one might almost say
so devoutly, the character of the extreme, the martyr type of anarchist,
the <i>propagandiste par le fait</i>.</p>

<p>Zola is said to have boasted of the progress anarchistic violence
made after he &#8220;launched his Souvarine into the world.&#8221;
The charge is probably a libel; but from this cold, calculating,
consecrated Souvarine of <i>Germinal</i> to the generous, sentimental
Salvat of Paris the sincere <i>propagandiste par le fait</i> was explained,
excused, admired, extolled by him.</p>

<p>This is not saying that Zola was consciously (or unconsciously)
an advocate of the <i>propagande par le fait</i>. He extended an equal
cordiality to all the reformers and innovators who are groping
towards a new and better world. The evils of contemporary
society are so gigantic, in his view, and the necessity for a change
of some sort so imperative, that he could understand and condone
any and every honest protest, no matter how imprudent and no
matter how fruitless.</p>

<p>Besides, Zola was more of an observer than a philosopher, and
more of a poet than either. His later works, and <i>Germinal</i> at
least among his earlier ones, are primarily prose epics. He
loved the dynamiter for his epic value as Milton loved his magnificent
Satan, and may have had no more intention of holding
him up to men as an exemplar than Milton had of instituting
devil-worship.</p>

<p class="captionc">EMILE ZOLA</p></div>

<p>It is not normal for the poet to have a coherent system, and it
is extremely doubtful if Zola had one. Still, the poet must have,
like other mortals, his personal point of view; and Zola&#8217;s personal
point of view (which is not for a moment to be confounded with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
his point of view as a poet) seems to have been that of the scientists
of his novels,&mdash;anarchistic as to end, but evolutionary as
to means: the attitude of Guillaume Froment in <i>Paris</i>, who
saw in &#8220;unities creating worlds, atoms producing life by attraction,
by free and ardent love, the only scientific theory of society,&#8221;
and who &#8220;dreamed of the emancipated individual evolving,
expanding without any restraint whatsoever, for his own good
and for the good of all.&#8221; The attitude of Bertheroy (<i>Paris</i>),
&#8220;who worked, in the seclusion of his laboratory, for the ruin
of the present superannuated and abominable r&eacute;gime, with
its God, its dogmas, its laws, but who desired also repose, too disdainful
of useless acts to join in the tumults of the street, preferring
to live tranquil, rich, recompensed, in peace with the government
(whatever it might be), all in foreseeing and preparing
the formidable issue of to-morrow,&#8221;&mdash;the Bertheroy who says:
&#8220;I have only contempt for the vain agitations of politics, revolutionary
or conservative. Does not science suffice? Of what
use is it to wish to hurry things when a single step of science does
more to advance humanity towards the city of justice and truth
than a hundred years of politics and social revolt? Science alone
is revolutionary: it alone can make not only truth, but justice
prevail, if justice is ever possible here below. Of a certainty,
it alone brushes away dogmas, expels the gods, creates light and
happiness. It is I, member of the Institute, rich and decorated,
who am the only revolutionist.&#8221; The attitude of Jordan (<i>Travail</i>),
&#8220;a completely emancipated spirit, a tranquil and terrible
evolutionist, sure that his labour will ravage and renew the world....
According to Jordan, it is science solely that leads humanity
to truth, to justice, to final happiness, to the perfect city of the
future towards which the peoples are so slowly and painfully advancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>All things considered, it would not be unfair, perhaps, to address
to Zola himself the words which he made this Jordan
speak to the reforming hero of <i>Travail</i>, Luc Froment: &#8220;Only,
my noble friend, you are nothing more nor less than an anarchist,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
complete evolutionist as you believe yourself; and you have every
reason to say that, while it is with the formula of Fourier that
we must begin, it is by <i>l&#8217;homme libre dans la commune libre</i> that
we must end.&#8221; And, if Zola had been thus addressed, it is not
unlikely that he would have replied laughingly, as he made his
Luc reply, &#8220;At any rate, let&#8217;s begin; and we shall see in due time
whither logic leads us.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no doubt possible regarding Zola&#8217;s belief in a good
time coming. His later books were fairly saturated with a sublime
faith almost childlike. There is also no doubt that he believed
that science consecrated to the service of humanity is quite capable
of regenerating the world, as he indicated by the communistic
experiment of Luc in <i>Travail</i>. But whether he believed
that science <i>will</i> be consecrated to the service of humanity or
whether he was presenting a method which might be employed,
and which he simply hoped, almost against hope, would be
so employed, is not so clear. Thus, in the last chapter of
<i>Travail</i>, after giving a beautiful picture of the superb results
of the peaceable revolution accomplished through the altruistic
initiative of Luc in the commune of Beauclair, he added a sort
of apocalyptic vision of the happenings in the principal divisions
of the big world outside, in which the same superb results have
been secured by violence,&mdash;by a bloody, socialistic <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>, by
the multiplication of anarchistic bombs, by a universal war,&mdash;quite
as if he would say to the classes in power: &#8220;I have shown
you how society may be renewed. I have shown you the way
of your salvation, the only way. If you would but walk in
this way, you might save yourselves and the world with you.
But you will not. You are too stupid, too selfish, too obstinate,
too corrupt. You will not. I have known you only too long,
and I know you will not. Well, then, so much the worse for you!
Expropriation, massacre, annihilation, await you!&#8221;</p>

<p>If you ask intellectual Frenchmen, without distinction of social
position or political faith, who is the foremost living French man
of letters, five out of six will answer, without an instant&#8217;s hesitation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Anatole France. Less pictorial, less colossal, and less
epic than Zola, but more penetrating and more profound; &aelig;sthetic
and erudite (in the good old-fashioned sense of the latter
word), subtile, suave, and refined; abundantly endowed with

the humour and the wit in which Zola was deficient;
as impeccable in point of language and
style as Zola was careless, as measured as Zola
was violent, as gentle as Zola was brutal, as
finished as Zola was crude; as perfect an embodiment
of the Greek spirit as Zola, if he had
only had a keener sense of the grotesque, would
have been of the Gothic,&mdash;Anatole
France is none the less a redoubtable
iconoclast,&mdash;the most redoubtable
iconoclast of his generation, perhaps.
A playful pessimist, a piquant anarchist,
a mischievous nihilist, if you
will, but a pessimist, an anarchist, a
nihilist, for all that. &#8220;Prejudices,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;are unmade and remade
without ceasing: they have the eternal mobility of the clouds. It
is in their nature to be august before appearing to be odious; and
the men are rare who have not the superstition of their time, and
who look straight in the eye what the crowd does not dare to look
at.&#8221; M. France is one of these rare men. He combines the
amiable doubt of Montaigne with the mocking irreverence of
Voltaire and the subversive grace of Renan. &#8220;The end which
M. France seems to pursue persistently,&#8221; says one of his literary
brethren, &#8220;is the demolition of the social edifice by the force of
a logic tinctured with irony, without anger, and without phrases.
By as much as Zola, Tailhade, and Mirbeau are ardent and
passionate when they attack society, by so much is M. France
calm and feline; but he is not, on that account, the less to be
feared.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the most eminent living representative of the best classic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
traditions of French prose, M. France is the idol of the lettered
youth of France. From admiration of form to acceptance of the
substance underlying the form is but a step. His ideas insinuate
themselves consequently into the very penetralia of culture,&mdash;that
exquisite culture which brooks the presence of nothing common
or unclean,&mdash;and they act as a disintegrating force in circles
where downright revolutionary propaganda cannot enter.</p>

<p>In his writings, Anatole France is the precise intellectual counterpart&mdash;at
every point but that of Catholicism, and even here
his passion for Augustine, Chrysostom, and the other Church
Fathers deters him from displaying an uncomely asperity&mdash;of
his own adorable creation, l&#8217;Abb&eacute; Coignard,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> the &#8220;delicious Catholic

as if they were a Merry Andrew&#8217;s painted spheres; the railing
anarchist who lashes with jests and whose only bombs are <i>bons
mots</i>.&#8221; And the best characterisation it is possible to give of
M. France, the genial iconoclast, is to repeat certain of his observations
on the character of his Abb&eacute; and certain of the sayings
he puts into his Abb&eacute;&#8217;s mouth,&mdash;which I accordingly do in the
following detached paragraphs, making no pretence of preserving

<p class="quote">&#8220;His free intelligence trampled under foot vulgar beliefs and
never accepted without examination the common opinion, except in
what had to do with the Catholic faith in which he was immovable.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The sagest of moralists, a sort of marvellous blend of Epicurus
and Saint Francis of Assisi.... He preserved, in his boldest
explorations, the attitude of a peaceful promenader.... It is
certain that the world, to his eyes, resembled less the deserts of
the Th&eacute;ba&iuml;de than the gardens of Epicurus. He sauntered
therein with the audacious ingenuousness which is the essential
trait of his character and the elemental principle of his teaching.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Never did spirit show itself at once so daring and so pacific,
nor temper its disdain with more sweetness.... He despised men
with tenderness. He endeavoured to teach them that, since they
have nothing anywhere near great in themselves except their capacity
for suffering, they can cultivate nothing useful or beautiful
but compassion.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It was his benevolence which impelled him to humiliate his
fellows in their sentiments, their knowledge, their philosophy,
and their institutions. He had to show them that their imbecile
natures have neither imagined nor constructed anything worth
being attacked or defended very energetically, and that, if they
knew the fragile crudity of their greatest works, such as laws
and empires, they would fight over them only in play, for the
sheer fun of the thing, like the children who build castles of sand
on the rim of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The majesty of the laws did not impose on his clairvoyant
soul; and he deplored the fact that the unfortunate are burdened
with so many obligations of which, for the most part, it is impossible
to discover the origin or the sense.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;What he had the least of was the sense of veneration. Nature
had refused it him, and he did nothing to acquire it. He would
have feared, in exalting some, to debase others; and his universal
charity embraced equally the humble and the proud.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center padt1 padb05"><span class="smcap">Some of Jer&ocirc;me Coignard&#8217;s Sayings.</span></p>

<p><i>Of Society and Governments</i>:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;After the destruction of all the false principles, society will
subsist, because it is founded upon necessity, the laws of which,
older than Saturn, will rule when Prometheus shall have dethroned
Jupiter.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I conclude that all the laws with which a minister swells his
portfolio are vain documents that can neither make us live nor
prevent us from living.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is well-nigh a matter of indifference whether we are governed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
in one fashion or another, and ministers are imposing only
by reason of their clothes and their carriages.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;These assemblies [parliaments] will be founded upon the confused
mediocrity of the multitude of which they will be the issue.
They will revolve obscure and multiple thoughts. They will
impose on the heads of the government the task of executing vague
wishes, of which they will not have full consciousness themselves;
and the ministers, less fortunate than the &OElig;dipus of the fable,
will be devoured, one after the other, by the hundred-headed
Sphinx, for not having guessed the riddle of which the Sphinx
herself did not know the answer. Their greatest hardship will be
to resign themselves to impotence, to words instead of action.
They will become rhetoricians, and very bad rhetoricians,
since the talent which carried with it ever so little clarity would
ruin them. They will be obliged to speak without saying anything,
and the least stupid among them will be condemned to
deceive more than the others. In this way the most intelligent
will become the most contemptible. And, if there shall be some
capable of arranging treaties, regulating finance, and supervising
affairs, their ability will profit them nothing; for time will be
lacking, and time is the stuff of great enterprises.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Of the Army</i>:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I have observed that the trade the most natural to man is
that of soldiering; it is the one towards which he is the most
easily borne by his instincts and by his tastes, which are not
all good. And apart from certain rare exceptions, of which
I am one, man may be defined as an animal with a musket.
Give him a handsome uniform and the hope of going to
fight, he will be content.... The military condition has
this also in keeping with human nature, that one is never
forced to think therein; and it is clear that we were not made
to think.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Thought is a disease peculiar to certain individuals, and
could not be propagated without bringing about promptly the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
of the species. Soldiers live in bands, and man is a sociable
animal. They wear costumes of blue and white, blue and red,
gray and blue, ribbons, plumes, and cockades; and these give them
the same prestige with women that the cock has with the hen.
They go forth marauding and to war; and man is naturally thieving,
libidinous, destructive, and sensible to glory.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is astounding, Tournebroche, my son, that war and the
chase, the mere thought of which ought to overwhelm us with
shame and remorse in recalling to us the miserable necessities

<span class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a name="f321" id="f321"></a><img src="images/f321.png" width="350" height="417"

of our nature and our inveterate wickedness,
should, on the contrary, serve as matter for the
pride of men; that Christians should continue to
honour the trade of butcher and headsman when
it is hereditary in the family;
and that, in a word,
among civilised peoples the
illustriousness of the citizens
is measured by the quantity
of murder and carnage they
carry, so to speak, in their
veins.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Of the Academy</i>:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Happy he who has not
put his hope in The Academy!
Happy he who lives
exempt from fears and desires,
and who knows that
it is equally vain to be an Academician and not to be an Academician!
Such a one leads, without trouble, a life hidden and obscure.
Beautiful liberty follows him everywhere. He celebrates
in the shade the silent orgies of wisdom, and all the Muses smile
on him as on their adept.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The immortality which has just been decreed to M. de
S&eacute;ez neither a Bossuet nor a Belzunce desires. It is not graven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
in the hearts of wondering peoples: it is inscribed in a big
register.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;If there are to be found, among the forty, persons of more
polish than genius, what harm is there in this? Mediocrity
triumphs in the Academy. Where does it not triumph? Do you
find it less powerful in the parliaments and in the councils of
the crown, where, surely, it is less in its place? Does one need
to be a rare man to work on a dictionary which pretends to
control usage and which can only follow it?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The <i>Acad&eacute;mistes</i> or <i>Acad&eacute;miciens</i> were instituted, as you
know, to fix the proper usage in what concerns discourse, to purge
the language of every venerable and popular impurity, and to
prevent the appearance of another Rabelais, another Montaigne,
<i>tout puant la canaille, la cuistrerie, et la province</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Genius is something unsociable. An extraordinary man
is rarely a man of resources. The Academy was very well able
to do without Descartes and Pascal. Who can say that it could
as easily have done without M. Godeau or M. Conrart?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Of Justice, Courts, and Judges</i>:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I hold man free in his acts because my religion teaches it;
but, outside the doctrine of the Church (which is unequivocal),
there is so little reason to believe in human liberty that I shudder
in thinking of the verdicts of a justice that punishes actions of
which the motives, the order, and the causes equally elude us,
in which the will has often little part, and which are sometimes
accomplished unconsciously.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Tournebroche, my son, consider that I am speaking of human
justice, which is different from the justice of God, and which is
generally opposed to it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The cruelest insult that men have been able to offer to our
Lord Jesus Christ has been the placing of his image in the halls
where the judges absolve the Pharisees who crucified him and
condemn the Magdalen whom he lifted up with his divine hands.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;What has he, the Just, to do with these men who could not
show themselves just, even if they wished it, since their dreary
duty is to consider the actions of their fellows not in themselves
and in their essence, but from the single point of view of the interests
of society; that is to say, in the interests of this mass of
egoism, avarice, errors, and abuses which constitute communities,
and of which they (the judges) are the blind conservators.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Judges do not sound the loins and do not read hearts,
and their justest justice is crude and superficial.... They are
men; that is to say, feeble and corruptible, gentle to the strong
and pitiless to the weak. They consecrate by their sentences
the cruelest social iniquities; and it is difficult to distinguish, in
this partiality, what comes from their personal baseness and
what is imposed on them by the duty of their profession, this
duty being, in reality, to support the State in what it has of evil
as well as in what it has of good; to watch over the conservation
of public morals, whether they are excellent or detestable....
Furthermore, it should be observed that the magistrate is the
defender, by virtue of his function, not only of the current prejudices
to which we are all more or less subject, but also of the time-worn
prejudices which are conserved in the laws after they have
been effaced from our souls and our habits. And there is not
a spirit ever so little meditative and free that does not feel how
much there is of Gothic in the law, while the judge has not the
right to feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;By the very nature of their profession, judges are inclined
to see a culprit in every prisoner; and their zeal seems so terrible
to certain European peoples that they have them assisted, in
important cases, by ten citizens chosen by lot. From which it
appears that chance, in its blindness, guarantees the life and
liberty of the accused better than the enlightenment of the judges
can. It is true that these impromptu bourgeois magistrates,
selected by a lottery, are held well outside the affair of which they
see only the exterior pomp. It is true further that, being ignorant
of the laws, they are called in, not to apply them, but also simply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
to decide, by a single word, if there is occasion to apply them. We
are told that assizes of this sort give absurd results sometimes,
but that the peoples who have established them cling to them
as to a highly precious protection. I easily believe it. And I
comprehend the acceptance of verdicts rendered in this fashion,
which may be inept and cruel, but of which the absurdity and
barbarity are, so to speak, attributable to nobody. Injustice
seems tolerable when it is sufficiently incoherent to appear involuntary.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Just now this little bailiff, who has so strong a sentiment
of justice, suspected me of belonging to the party of thieves and
assassins. On the contrary, I so far disapprove theft and assassination
that I cannot endure even the copy of them regularised
by the laws; and it is painful for me to see that judges have found
no better means of punishing robbers and homicides than by
imitating them. For, after all, Tournebroche, my son, in good
faith, what are fines and the death penalty, if not robbery and
assassination perpetrated with an august exactitude? And do
you not see that our justice merely tends, in all its pride, to this
shame of avenging an evil by an evil, a suffering by a suffering,
and in doubling misdemeanours and crimes in the name of equilibrium
and symmetry?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Customs have more force than laws. Gentleness of demeanour
and sweetness of spirit are the only remedies which can reasonably
be applied to legal barbarity. For to correct laws by laws
is to take a slow and uncertain route.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">But for the historic setting, the turn of the phrase, and the
absence of bitterness, one might fancy himself reading the contemporary
anarchist organs, <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i> and <i>Le Libertaire</i>.</p>

<p>Anatole France is as chary of Utopias as Zola is prone to them.
He fears nothing so much as intemperance of emotion and speech.
He believes in nothing, not even in his own unbelief. &#8220;If ever
M. Anatole France,&#8221; says Gaston Deschamps, &#8220;seeks martyrdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
it will be to confess the doctrine of the relativity of knowledge,
to affirm the nothingness of human opinions, and to attest,
at the price of his blood, that there is no truth&#8221;; and yet it was
apropos of this same M. France that this same M. Deschamps,
in the course of a contention that literature always ends by having
its way, sounded the note of warning placed at the beginning
of this chapter.</p>

<p>In spite of the dilettante humour or, to be more accurate, the
dilettante philosophy that informs his writings, Anatole France
did not remain within his <i>tour d&#8217;ivoire</i> during that strange Dreyfus
affair which transformed nearly every literary Frenchman into
an agitator&mdash;for one side or the other. Like Zola and like most
of his fellow-craftsmen of an anarchistic or socialistic bent, he
engaged actively in the anti-militarist campaign, the pretext of
which was the wrongs of a Jew whom they believed to be persecuted.
In M. France, apostle of the nothingness of things in
general and in particular, such a course was very surprising and,
it must be admitted, very inconsistent. His most plausible excuse
probably is that he could not help himself, his chivalrous
instincts proving stronger than his quietism. But he might
defend himself, if he thought it worth while, by citing the reply
of Jer&ocirc;me Coignard to his satellite Tournebroche when the latter
inquired why he would &#8220;reduce to dust the foundations of equity,
of justice, of laws, and of all the civil and military magistracies&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;My son, I have always observed that the troubles of men
come to them from their prejudices, as spiders and scorpions
come from the dimness of cellars and from the humidity of vaults.
It is good to flourish the broom and the brush a little in all the
dark corners. It is good even to give a little blow of the pick
here and there in the walls of the cellar and garden to frighten
the vermin and prepare the necessary ruins.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. France has not yet gone back into the <i>tour d&#8217;ivoire</i> from which
the irresistible &#8220;Affair&#8221; drew him. He is a member of the executive
committee of the Co-operative Bakery and a leader in the organisation
of the <i>Universit&eacute;s Populaires</i>; he presided on the occasion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
of the Victor Hugo Centennial over a gigantic mass meeting of
the latter, in which he gave &#8220;a little blow of the pick&#8221; to clericalism;

<span class="captionc">OCTAVE MIRBEAU</span></span>

and in 1903 he contributed an introduction
to Premier Combes&#8217; volume
<i>Campagne La&iuml;que</i>, in defence of
anti-clericalism.</p>

<p>At a recent anniversary of Diderot,
whom both anarchists and
socialists claim as an ancestor,
but who is more particularly an
idol of the anarchists, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Citoyens</i>, master-spirits who
are our friends have come here
to speak of Diderot, the savant,
and Diderot, the philosopher.
As for me, I have only a word
to say. I desire to show you
Diderot, the friend of the people.
This son of the cutler of
Langres was an excellent man.
A contemporary of Voltaire and of
Rousseau, he was the best of men in the
best of centuries.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He loved men and the pacific works
of men. He conceived the great design
of lifting up into esteem the manual
trades looked down upon by the military, civil, and religious
aristocracies.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Citoyens</i>, at a time when the united enemies of knowledge,
of peace, of liberty, arm themselves against the Republic, and
threaten to stifle democracy under the weight of all that which
does not think, or thinks only against thought, you have had
a happy inspiration in singling out for honour the memory of this
philosopher who teaches men happiness through work, knowledge,
and love; and who, looking far into the future, announced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
the new era, the coming of the proletariat into a pacified and
comforted world.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;His penetrating view discerned our present struggles and
our future successes. And it is not too much to say that
Diderot, whose memory we celebrate to-day, Diderot, dead for
one hundred and twenty years, touches us very closely; that
he is ours, a great servitor of the people and a defender of the
proletariat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anatole France is the gentlest and subtlest ironist of his time;
Octave Mirbeau (to whom M. France&#8217;s <i>Jer&ocirc;me Coignard</i> was
dedicated) is the fiercest. M. Mirbeau has not yet obtained the
world renown of Zola nor the national renown of M. France,
but he may become in time as famous as either. He surpasses
every living French writer in portraying the monstrous, the atrocious,
and the horrible, and in expressing hatred and disgust;
and his irony&mdash;too often fulminated, in violation of the commonest
courtesy, not to say decency, against individuals antipathetic
to him&mdash;rives and blasts like the thunderbolt. It is doubtful
if the world has seen anything comparable to him for vitriolic
vindictiveness since England had Dean Swift. He is bitter,
brutal, savage, terrifying to the last degree; &#8220;one of those combative
natures,&#8221; says Eug&egrave;ne Montfort, &#8220;who are dreaded because
their conviction partakes of the nature of an animate being, ...
breathes, feeds, grows, is endowed with the instinct of self-preservation
and struggles for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>His <i>Calvaire</i>, as he himself puts it, &#8220;strips war of all its heroism.&#8221;
His <i>Journal d&#8217;une Femme de Chambre</i> is the most complete
and awful arraignment of society it is possible to imagine between
the covers of a single volume. Merciless towards the hypocrisy
and hollowness of the hour, towards meanness and pretentiousness,
towards impotent and misdirected philanthropy, above all,
towards the stupidity and ugliness of the smug bourgeois, whom
he fairly flays alive as Apollo flayed Marsyas, M. Mirbeau is,
on the other hand,&mdash;and here his resemblance to Swift ceases,&mdash;infinitely
humane and uplifting, full of tenderness and chivalry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
for the outcast and unfortunate, for the goodness which would
diffuse happiness everywhere; full of generous ardour, high aspiration,
and unfaltering faith in the ultimate triumph of the
just.</p>

<p>M. Mirbeau is a declared anarchist; and, as such, he published
a wonderful Apology of Ravachol, furnished an introduction for
Jean Grave&#8217;s most famous volume, and played a leading r&ocirc;le in
the Dreyfus affair.</p>

<p>His <i>chroniques</i> are daring, incisive, brilliant, explosive, virile,
insulting. They cut, burn, scald, corrode. His short stories
are passionate, dramatic, lyrical even, all in being realistic. His
novels, though they deal only indirectly with public issues, are
upon all the anarchist library lists.</p>

<p>Emile Zola, Anatole France, and Octave Mirbeau are held,
by many persons who do not in the least share their views, to be
the three pre-eminent masters of modern French fiction. On a
distinctly lower plane than these three, but still far above mediocrity,
are two other novelists of a revolutionary cast, Lucien Descaves
and Victor Barrucand.</p>

<p>Descaves demonstrated in his first volume&mdash;a collection of
short stories entitled <i>Le Calvaire d&#8217;H&eacute;lo&iuml;se Pajadin</i>&mdash;the depressing
and degrading influence of the decent poverty of petty clerks
and tradesmen; his <i>La Colonne</i> portrayed the contrasts of the
Commune; and his <i>Soupes</i> exposed the hypocrisies, cruelties, and
absurdities of professional and amateur charity and philanthropy.
But M. Descaves&#8217; specialty is the army: it is in his
novels of the barracks that he is at his best, and by these works
he is best known.</p>

<p>In these books, with a talent which approaches genius, through
hundreds of pages he holds the reader&#8217;s attention to the flat,
stale, and unprofitable barrack life,&mdash;to its pettiness, selfishness,
monotony, physical and moral untidiness, desolation and disgust,&mdash;a
life entirely lacking in all that we are accustomed to consider
the material for romance. Under his skilful handling the commonplace
and the vulgar become alternately tragic and grimly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
comic; and his <i>Sous-Offs</i> and <i>Emmur&eacute;s</i>, to which he owes his
nomination as a charter member of the <i>Acad&eacute;mie Goncourt</i>, are
almost classics of their kind. Less exalted and less epic than
Zola, of whose big, spectacular qualities he is quite destitute, Descaves
is, nevertheless, much closer to Zola than he is to Mirbeau
or to France. And he easily surpasses Zola in the latter&#8217;s much-heralded
but rather superficial realism; that is, in the capacity
for heaping up significantly and without boresomeness minute,
unromantic details.</p>

<p>Descaves has a square bull-dog head and jaw, if his photographs
are to be trusted. He certainly has a bull-dog&#8217;s fixity
of purpose in the matter of both substance and form. Nothing
in the world will induce him to relax his grip on his immediate
aim to indulge in fine ideas or fine writing. His style is cold,
hard, dry, correct, keen, and sure. He is an out-and-out anarchist,
who has played a fairly active part in the events of the last
few years. His <i>Sous-Offs</i>, though entirely free from doctrinal
discussion, cost him, by reason of its damaging revelations, an
encounter with the law. No other novel&mdash;indeed, no other work
of this generation, unless it be Bruant&#8217;s <i>chanson</i>, <i>Biribi</i>&mdash;has
exerted so profound an anti-militarist influence in France.</p>

<p>In 1895 Victor Barrucand published in the <i>Revue Blanche</i> a
series of articles, concluding with a serious proposition for the
establishment of &#8220;<i>Le Pain Gratuit</i>&#8221; (free bread); and on the
occasion of the municipal elections of that year he placarded
the principal communes of France with the following appeal:&mdash;</p>

<p class="name">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Victor Barrucand.</span>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p class="tb">In <i>Avec le Feu</i>, a novel whose action is placed in the troubled
period of the execution of Vaillant and the overt act of Emile
Henry, M. Barrucand has given an exceedingly subtle and suggestive
study of the disgust with society of a certain element of
the intellectual <i>&eacute;lite</i>, and of the reasons for their espousal of the
anarchist cause.</p>

<p>The principal character, one Robert, is a good type of the
cultured, semi-neurasthenic anarchist of a period chiefly characterised
by its restlessness and yearning:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;On certain evenings he descended into the street, and saturated
himself with the crowd. On the benches he breathed the
mortality of the squares. He suffered for these miserable cattle
who bleed no more under the goad of conscience. He roamed
entire nights as chance led, hunting the d&eacute;bris of souls, exploring
with his emotions, as with a dark lantern, the pavements of the
drowsy city. At daybreak he came back shivering, coughing,
weary with over-walking, drunk with pity, his stomach steeped
in bad drinks. He concluded then that labour had brutalised
the species, and he sought the secret of lifting it up. On these
mornings he speculated daringly, dreamed of sacrifices, of revolts,
of noble disdains, of ferocious protests against philanthropy
and respectability. A savour of death blended with his charity
and perfumed his heroic sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The novel ends dramatically, not with bomb-throwing, but
with suicide, which this strange anarchist hero, who aspires to
bomb-throwing, without having the necessary force of character
to achieve it, chooses in its stead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>It would be unfair to class M. Barrucand as an anarchist, or
even as a revolutionist, on the strength of this book, in spite of
the generally sympathetic tone which pervades it. In fact, M.
Barrucand&#8217;s philosophy as displayed therein is of so cynical and,
at times, of so flippant an order, his temperament so weary and
so buoyant, his moral outlook so severe and lackadaisical, his
style so lurid and simple, his appreciations so morbid and sane,
and his literary method so impressionistic, realistic, and symbolic,
by turns, that it would be rash to draw any conclusions
from it whatsoever, did not his attitude in his other works&mdash;notably
in his two historical biographies, <i>La Vie V&eacute;ritable du Citoyen
Rossignol</i>, <i>Vainqueur de la Bastille</i>, and <i>M&eacute;moires et Notes de
Choudieu, Repr&eacute;sentant du Peuple</i>&mdash;and his identification with the
movement for Free Bread enroll him definitively in the ranks of
revolt.</p>

<p>Maurice Barr&egrave;s, who is at present an apostle of nationalism,
was at one time classed as a &#8220;sentimental anarchist,&#8221;&mdash;an anarchist
&#8220;with a rebel&#8217;s brain and a voluptuary&#8217;s nerves, who
would wear purple and fine linen.&#8221; &#8220;I am an enemy of the
laws,&#8221; he said at that time.</p>

<p>Among other French novelists and short-story writers of a certain
reputation who are more or less revolutionary in tone may
be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>Georges Darien, author of <i>Biribi-Arm&eacute;e d&#8217;Afrique</i>, a novel
of the convict-legion, which has proved a potent factor in lessening
the rigours of the companies of discipline; Dubois-Dessaulle,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
author of <i>Sous la Casaque</i>, who, after being released
from the convict-legion to which he had been consigned
(because a brochure by Jean Grave and an article by
S&eacute;v&eacute;rine were found in his knapsack), had the superhuman courage
to soak his left arm in kerosene and set fire to it in order
to avoid ever being sent back into this inferno; Jean Ajalbert,
author of <i>Sous le Sabre</i>; Marcel Lami, author of <i>La D&eacute;bandade</i>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Louis Lamarque, author of <i>Un An de Caserne</i>; Paul Brulat,
author of <i>La Faiseuse de Gloire</i>, <i>Le Nouveau Candide</i>, <i>La Gangue</i>,
and <i>Eldorado</i>, books replete with generous indignation against
social abuses; Jean Lombard, one of the makers of the programme
of the <i>Congr&egrave;s R&eacute;gional</i> of Paris (1880) which declared for class
candidates, whose untimely death was a great loss to French
literature; Camille Pert, author of <i>En l&#8217;Anarchie</i>; Henri Rainaldy,
author of <i>Delcros</i>, an exposure of the cowardices and murderousness
of society; Adolphe Rett&eacute;, author of <i>Le R&eacute;gicide</i>; Marcel
Schwob, author of <i>Spicilege</i>; Mme. S&eacute;v&eacute;rine, author of <i>Pages
Rouges</i>; Frantz Jourdain, author of <i>L&#8217;Atelier Chanterel</i>; Z&eacute;phirin
Raganasse, author of <i>Fabrique de Pions</i>; Louis Lumet, author
of <i>La Fi&egrave;vre</i>; M. Reepmaker, author of <i>Vengeance</i>; Th&eacute;odore
Ch&egrave;ze, Henri F&egrave;vre, Jules Cazes, Pierre Valdagne, and the <i>feuilletoniste</i>
Michel Zevacco.</p>

<p>A number of the revolutionists who are primarily public agitators
have made attempts of varying merit to propagate their
pet ideas through the medium of fiction. Such are S&eacute;bastien
Faure with his <i>romans-feuilletons</i> and Jean Grave with his <i>Malfaiteurs</i>,
his military romance, <i>La Grande Famille</i>, and his book
for boys, <i>Les Aventures de Nono</i>.</p>

<p>The most thorough single-volume study that has as yet appeared
of the psychology of the different varieties of contemporary
revolutionary types, and of their aims and methods, is unquestionably
J.-H. Rosny&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> romance, <i>Le Bilat&eacute;ral</i>. But M. Rosny,
although he has appeared on a public platform in company with
professed <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;s</i>, to protest against &#8220;<i>La Cruaut&eacute; Contemporaine</i>,&#8221;
is primarily a scientific observer, who cannot reasonably be classed
as an agitator.</p>

<p>Like the hero of this romance (H&eacute;lier, the &#8220;Bilat&eacute;ral,&#8221; who habitually
looks at all sides of a subject, and then looks at them again),
Rosny is impassive, impartial, tolerant, eclectic. Far from excusing
the crimes and errors of the capitalistic state, he is equally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
far from throwing in his lot with those who would incontinently
overturn it.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To think,&#8221; says the Bilat&eacute;ral to his <i>doctrinaire</i> socialist and
anarchist friends, &#8220;that there are multitudes of brave souls like
you who, like you, see only white and black. Nothing but white
and black! Why, <i>citoyens</i>, the complex is grey, all shades of
grey.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">Again he says: &#8220;You see, my dear&#8221; (he is speaking to an ardent
socialist girl), &#8220;that in the things of the social order we meet
rarely a problem simple enough to make it possible to assert;&mdash;&#8216;it
is this&#8217; or &#8216;it is that.&#8217; Generally, between <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> there
are an endless number of points to elucidate.... There is a high
civilisation with plenty of grain, with immense unemployed forces,
with a science already so large that it can resolve the problem
of giving to all a nest and nourishment; ... and those above are
stupid, and those below are stupid, and all so evilly disposed!
My God! dear child, if the people were not a brutal instinct,
we might indeed hope for a consoling solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, again, speaking to a group upon the Bourse: &#8220;&#8216;History,
science, daily observation, demonstrate to us that nothing durable
is elaborated without the aid of the great collaborator, Time.
Did this horse-chestnut-tree grow in a day? And you would have
the humanity which has evolved so slowly&mdash;oh, so slowly!&mdash;through
myriads of years, humanity bounded by prejudices, by
predispositions against progressive ideas, humanity which includes
a hundred social sects ready to combat each other,&mdash;you
would have this humanity change by means of a lousy, bloody,
revolution? Granted that once, after centuries of patience,
a cataclysm like that of &#8216;93 occurred. (And, even so, France,
properly speaking, has no reason to felicitate itself over Jacobinism.)
But you pretend to establish as a normal condition these
cataclysms which can be only the exception in the social life;
and it is this that I am powerless to conceive.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Bravo!&#8217; exclaimed the bourgeois.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;I have nothing to do with your bravos!&#8217; cried the Bilat&eacute;ral,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
with a shade of nervousness. &#8216;If their ignorance saddens me, your
rottenness exasperates me; and it is not of protecting the rich that
I think, but of preventing a generous minority of the poor from
getting themselves butchered to no purpose or from casting
France into the maw of the rival powers. As to the vile and
cowardly cormorants, the whole race of big and little parasites,
the vermin that swarm in this pseudo-republic alongside of the
Orleanist penny-scrapers and the pests of imperialism, if I had
only to press a button to annihilate them all, I would not hesitate
a second.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Other fiction writers who have shown an understanding of the
gravity of the revolutionary issue, a familiarity with revolutionary
tenets and the workings of the revolutionary mind, but whose
points of view are either neutral, like Rosny&#8217;s, or frankly hostile,
are Rachilde, Jane de la Vaud&egrave;re, Augustin L&eacute;ger, Paul Dubost,
and Adolphe Chenevi&egrave;re. These have aided the propaganda,
in their own despite, by rendering the revolutionary types familiar
and comprehensible, and so lifting them out of the category of
monsters.</p>

<p>It seems that Emile Henry&#8217;s favourite book, his &#8220;<i>livre de chevet</i>,&#8221;
the book which he contrived to secrete in his cell during a part
of his imprisonment, and which his jailers, when they pounced
upon it, imagined to be of the most incendiary nature, was Cervantes&#8217;
<i>Don Quixote</i>. And it is not infrequently the case, in this
matter of literature, that the most potent revolutionary agents
are those which make the least pretence of being so. The masterpieces
of the humourists Meilhac, Hal&eacute;vy, Tristan Bernard,
Jules Renard, Pierre Veber, and Georges Court&eacute;line, which hold
up to ridicule rather than to reprobation the emptiness and baseness
of society; such books of pity and of pardon as Daudet&#8217;s
<i>Jack</i>, Goncourt&#8217;s <i>Fille Elisa</i>, and Loti&#8217;s <i>Livre de la Piti&eacute; et de la
Mort</i>; books of aspiration, like Pr&eacute;vost&#8217;s <i>Confessions d&#8217;un Amant</i>
and Bourget&#8217;s <i>Terre Promise</i>; of wrath, like L&eacute;on Daudet&#8217;s <i>Morticoles</i>;
of &#8220;revolt against Puritanism,&#8221; like Pierre Louys&#8217; <i>Aphrodite</i>;
of energy, like Barr&egrave;s&#8217; <i>D&eacute;racin&eacute;s</i>; of searching, like Huysmanns&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
<i>Cath&eacute;drale</i>; of regret, like Bazin&#8217;s <i>Terre qui Meurt</i>; of
unmoral pessimism, like De Maupassant&#8217;s <i>Bel-Ami</i>; and the
whole range of disquieting feminist fiction,&mdash;may turn out to be
the most active social ferments and the real forerunners (little as
their authors would wish it) of violent change,&mdash;of revolt and
revolution!</p>

<p>All contemporary fiction, in fact, has in it something of the
doubt, the trouble, and the protest of the period; and, once upon
this tack, nothing less than a minute examination of every novel
and volume of short stories that has appeared since the Franco-Prussian
war would be imposed.</p>

<p>Of the essayists, critics, and philosophers<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> who are more or
less militant iconoclasts and <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;s</i>, the most important are:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Ferdinand H&eacute;rold, who expounds his attitude as follows:
&#8220;From the time I was able to think a little for myself, I have
had an anarchist mind. I mean that I have always had a horror
of undisputed authority, of dogmatism, and of conventional
ideas,&mdash;ideas which, the greater part of the time, one does not
attempt to justify to himself&#8221;; Camille Mauclair, who says: &#8220;If
anarchy is primarily the reform of ethics, in accordance with the
principles of individualism, I can declare squarely that anarchy
was born in me, with the study of metaphysics and the awakening
of sensibility in the period when I began to know myself.... Furthermore,
pity for the disinherited and execration of the
spoliators is a point of honour for the few clean and upright people
who are still to be found in the world&#8221;; Bernard Lazare,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> who
says: &#8220;Authority, its value, and its <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> are things which
I have never been able to comprehend. That a man arrogate
to himself the right to domineer over his fellows, in any fashion
whatsoever, is still inconceivable to me. At first I regarded myself
as the only victim of baneful circumstances and vicious wills.
Later I came to consider mankind at large; and from my own
sentiments I divined the feelings of those who more or less continuously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
or at some moment of their existence, are slaves. Then
what had appeared to me odious for myself appeared to me odious
for all&#8221;; Gustave Geffroy, who devoted a decade to his biography
of the Communard Blanqui, entitled <i>L&#8217;Enferm&eacute;</i>; Henry
Mazel, who exclaimed in the <i>Mercure de France</i>, &#8220;We are all
anarchists, thank God!&#8221; Alfred Naquet, a convert from nationalism;

Victor Charbonnel, ex-priest and editor of <i>La Raison</i>, and Henri
B&eacute;renger, editor of <i>L&#8217;Action</i>, who have acted together in exciting
the masses to anti-clerical rioting; the socialist-anthropologist

<p>In the first months of 1891 a weekly publication called <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
(<i>The Outsider</i>) was founded by a band of young literary
men. They were Zo d&#8217;Axa, Roinard, Georges Darien, F&eacute;lix
F&eacute;n&eacute;on, Lucien Descaves, Victor Barrucand, Arthur Byl, A.
Tabarant, Bernard Lazare, Charles Malato, Pierre Quillard,
Ghil, Edmond Cousturier, Henri F&egrave;vre, Edouard Dubus, A. F.
H&eacute;rold, Georges Lecomte, Etienne Decrept, Emile Henry,
Saint-Pol-Roux, Jules M&eacute;ry, Alexandre Cohen, J. LeCoq, Chatel,
Cholin, Ludovic Malquin, Camille Mauclair, Octave Mirbeau,
Lucien Muhlfeld, Pierre Veber, Victor Melnotte, A. Mercier,
Tristan Bernard, Paul Adam, Charles Saunier, Jean Ajalbert,
Emile Verhaeren, Henri de Regnier, and Francis Viel&eacute;-Griffin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>The journal bore by way of epigraph this phrase of its leading
spirit and director, Zo d&#8217;Axa: &#8220;<i>Celui que rien n&#8217;enr&ocirc;le et qu&#8217;une
impulsive nature guide seule, ce hors la loi, ce hors d&#8217;&eacute;cole, cet
isol&eacute; chercheur d&#8217;au del&agrave;, ne se dessine-t-il pas dans ce mot, L&#8217;Endehors?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It explained its purpose as follows: &#8220;We belong neither to a
party nor to a group. We are outsiders. We go on our way,
individuals, without the Faith which saves and blinds. Our disgust
with society does not engender convictions in us. We fight
for the pleasure of fighting without dreaming of a better future.
What matter to us the to-morrows which in the centuries shall
be! What matter to us the little nephews! It is <i>endehors</i>, outside
of all laws, of all rules, of all theories, even anarchistic; it
is now, from this moment, that we wish to give ourselves over
to our compassions, to our transports, to our gentleness, to our
wrath, to our instincts, with the proud consciousness of being ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first number of <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> appeared in May, 1891, immediately
after the massacre of Fourmies,&mdash;in which old men,
women, and children, among them a young girl bearing a hawthorn
sprig by way of a flag of truce, were shot down by the troops
of the government,&mdash;and dealt bravely and scathingly with this
horrible incident; and the last number was issued in January,
1893, when the paper was forcibly suppressed.</p>

<p>The staff of <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> defended and even glorified Ravachol.
Mirbeau&#8217;s &#8220;<i>Apologie de Ravachol</i>&#8221; (referred to above) is one of
the finest bits of impassioned writing he has ever done. Paul
Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<i>Eloge de Ravachol</i>&#8221; is also noteworthy. Here is a
brief extract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Politics would have been banished completely from our preoccupations,
had not the legend of sacrifice, of the gift of a life
for the happiness of humanity, suddenly reappeared in our epoch,
with the martyrdom of Ravachol.... At the end of all these
judicial proceedings, <i>chroniques</i>, and calls to legal murder, Ravachol
stands as the unmistakable propagator of the great idea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
of the ancient religions, which extolled the seeking of death by
the individual for the good of the world,&mdash;the abnegation of one&#8217;s
self, of one&#8217;s life, and one&#8217;s good name by the exaltation of the
humble and the poor. Ravachol is plainly the restorer of the
essential sacrifice....</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He saw suffering round about him, and he has ennobled the
suffering of others by offering his own in a holocaust. His incontestable
charity and disinterestedness, the energy of his acts,
his courage before inevitable death, lift him into the splendours
of legend. In this time of cynicism and of irony <span class="smcap">A SAINT IS
BORN TO US</span>. His blood will be the example from which new
courages and new martyrs will spring. The grand idea of universal
altruism will bloom in the red pool at the foot of the guillotine.
A fruitful death is about to be consummated. An event
of human history is about to be inscribed in the annals of the
peoples. The legal murder of Ravachol will open a new era.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> prophesied (or rather supposed), in an article entitled
&#8220;<i>Notre Complot</i>,&#8221; Vaillant&#8217;s attempt against the Chamber;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
and the ex-members of its staff participated, after its supposition
had become a fact, in the phenomenal demonstrations at
Vaillant&#8217;s tomb. The indignation in literary circles over the
execution of Vaillant was so intense that M. Magnard in <i>Le
Figaro</i> uttered a vigorous protest against &#8220;<i>la Vaillantol&acirc;trie</i>&#8221;;
and the most orthodox writers in the most orthodox journals
suddenly proclaimed the necessity of stemming this tide of anarchistic
heresy in high places (to which <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> had, so to
speak, first given a habitation and a name) by the accomplishment
of a number of necessary but long-delayed legal and social
reforms.</p>

<p>The unlettered protagonist of Augustin L&eacute;ger&#8217;s novel <i>Le Journal
d&#8217;un Anarchiste</i> appreciates the review conducted by one Hector
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
de la Roche-Sableuse, of which <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> may well have been
the model, in the following fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;After all, in spite of their gibberish, these reviews of the
<i>jeunes gens</i> lent me by Roche-Sableuse are sometimes interesting.
They shed crocodile tears over the lot of the people? It is
possible. They do not believe a word of what they write?
I do not say no. All this does not prevent them from seeing
clearly at times, and from putting their fingers often on the truth.
Besides, although these fine little <i>messieurs</i> are not in the least
anxious at heart for the triumph of the proletariat, because they
know very well that it would remove several cushions from under
their elbows, they understand and they expound perfectly the
legitimacy of our claims. And I applaud with both hands the
eulogiums they pronounce on the noble victims our cause already
counts. In short, they have interested me, and I have learned
not a little from them.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> was publicly praised by Georges Clemenceau, Henri
Bauer, Laurent-Tailhade, and Jean de Mitty. The last-named
said of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;This little sheet so modest in appearance and at the same
time so fastidious in make-up that it might easily have been taken
for a club periodical or for the exclusive organ of a few &aelig;sthetes,
raised more tempests and provoked more passions than a riot
in the street. Violent it certainly was, and violent with a violence
which, for wearing always a literary, subtile, and complex
form, penetrated no less deeply, and gained no less to its object
the scattered energies and wills that were craving definite
guidance. Opportune or not, the influence of <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> was
exerted effectively.... But, aside from its action on public affairs,
the journal of Zo d&#8217;Axa realised an incontestable intellectual
effort; and it is for the beauty of this effort that it pleases
me to invoke it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to be noted that Emile Henry, in whose pontifical attitude
before his judges even his bitterest antagonists found &#8220;something
atrociously superior and disquieting,&#8221; and in whom the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
sympathetic Albert Delacour discerns, or thinks he discerns (by
reason of his solitary meditations, his perpetual ratiocination,
his hatred of action up to the moment of supreme action,
his disgust with life,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and his brooding on death), a modern
Hamlet, is the only member of the <i>Endehors</i> group who has committed
an overt act of violence.</p>

<p>Of the rest, some have since identified themselves closely with
socialism, some with Boulangism and nationalism, and some
with anarchism; some have given themselves to the creation of
the humorous or the beautiful without too obvious a destructive
prepossession; and some have held themselves scrupulously
&#8220;<i>endehors</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most have remained <i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;s</i> of one sort or another. Only a
few have conformed, and a part of these only outwardly. Thus
Paul Adam, who has seemed several times, by reason of the enormous
range of his interests and the disconcerting agility of his intelligence,
to be utterly lost to revolution, has written, nevertheless,
a number of novels of revolutionary trend. He published in
1900 a defence of Bresci which might have been written the very
same day as his &#8220;<i>Eloge</i>&#8221; of Ravachol, and he reaffirmed his essential
anarchism as late as the spring of 1904.</p>

<p>Of those who have remained strictly &#8220;<i>endehors</i>,&#8221; Zo d&#8217;Axa,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
uncorrected by hard experiences of prison and exile, resumed
in 1898 his assault upon the abuses of society in his now famous
<i>Feuilles</i> with a fierceness, a versatility, an independence, a finesse,
a facility in anathema, and a redundance in disdain that
have rarely, if ever, been matched in revolutionary pamphleteering&mdash;and
privateering. It was as if Mirbeau, with all the withering
force of his mighty scorn, had descended into the street, or
as if <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i> had attained the level of literature.</p>

<p>The <i>Feuilles de Zo d&#8217;Axa</i> appeared irregularly in the form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
of placards, as events invited, during the troubled years of 1898
and 1899, and created an enormous sensation. Nothing was
exempt from the sharpshooting of this guerilla of the asphalt,&mdash;this
handsome, red-bearded &#8220;<i>mousquetaire chercheur de justes
aventures</i>,&#8221; whom all Paris knows by his picturesque brown cape
and felt.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;To the argument of the multitude,&#8221; he wrote in his salutatory,
&#8220;to the catechism of the crowds, to all the <i>raisons-d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i> of
the collectivity, behold the personal reasons of the Individual
oppose themselves!... He goes his way, he acts, he takes aim,
because a combative instinct makes him prefer the chase to the
nostalgic siesta. On the borders of the code he poaches the big
game,&mdash;officers and judges, bucks or <i>carnivori</i>. He dislodges
from the forests of Bondy the herd of politicians. He amuses
himself by snaring the ravaging financier. He beats up at all
the cross-roads the domesticated <i>gent de lettres</i>, fur and feathers;
all the debauchers of ideas, all the monsters of the press and the
police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucien Descaves compares the series of Zo d&#8217;Axa&#8217;s writings
to &#8220;a beautiful road bordered with pity and hatred and paved
with wrath and revolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He says further of him: &#8220;Zo d&#8217;Axa&#8217;s phrase is rapid. The
fuse of his articles is short. When a match is approached to them,
something is bound to explode; and D&#8217;Axa is quite capable of
sacrificing himself, if need be, in the explosion. He has proved it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suppression of <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i> (whose complete file is now one
of the rarities of the book-mart) and the consequent dispersion
of the <i>Endehors</i> band were soon followed by the formation of
another revolutionary coterie of young poets, men of letters, and
sociologists, called &#8220;<i>Le Groupe de l&#8217;Id&eacute;e Nouvelle</i>.&#8221; This group
(of whom Paul Adam, A. Hamon, Victor Barrucand, and Jean
Carri&egrave;re were the most prominent figures) organised a series of
<i>soir&eacute;es-conf&eacute;rences</i>, which were given at the <i>H&ocirc;tel Continental</i>,
during the winter of 1893-94, with great success.</p>

<p><i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Nouvelle</i> (somewhat tamed by time, it is true) still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
exists. The following announcement, which appeared in 1900
in the anarchist journal <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i>, explains its more
recent activities and aims:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Nouvelle</i> informs the public that hereafter it adds
to its title <i>La R&eacute;novation Sociale par le Travail</i>, and announces
that the first <i>conf&eacute;rence</i> of the year will be given at the <i>H&ocirc;tel des
Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s Savantes</i>, Sunday, November 18, at three o&#8217;clock, by the
poet and <i>chansonnier</i> Xavier Privas.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Subject, &#8216;<i>L&#8217;Argent contre
l&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</i>.&#8217; The second, to be given early in December
by the sculptor Jean Baffier, will treat &#8216;<i>La Corporation Autonome
et l&#8217;Entreprise Capitaliste</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>To the former committee of <i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Nouvelle</i>, composed of
men of letters, among whom were Paul Adam, Jules Cazes, Lucien
Descaves, Louis de Grammont, Georges Lecomte, and L&eacute;opold
Lacour, the artists Eug&egrave;ne Carri&egrave;re, Jules Dalou, and Steinlen,
and the geographer Elis&eacute;e Reclus, consented to join themselves
at the time of the adoption of its new name.</p>

<p>Here is the text of the declarations by means of which <i>La
R&eacute;novation Sociale par le Travail</i> quickly rallied to its support
many of those of the intellectual <i>&eacute;lite</i> who are thinking and acting
along the lines of the better aspirations of humanity:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Believing that the action of money as a medium of exchange is
universally injurious, that it is the source of all the turpitudes and
all the infamies of society; that almost all the crimes, the enmities,
the divisions, have for their initial cause a question of interest,&mdash;namely,
money; believing also that money, far from being, as some
pretend, a stimulus to production, is rather an obstacle to it; that
venality and mercantilism dishonour and paralyse art, kill noble
dreams and generous ambitions; that too often, in the actual condition
of society, we propose to ourselves as the end of life, not an
ideal of beauty, of truth, of justice, but money; believing, further,
that there is no other means for counteracting such a situation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
than by glorifying, rehabilitating, and equitably apportioning
labour, and by insisting strenuously on this law of nature, that
every consumer should be a producer, the consumption being
proportioned to the need, and the production to the faculty and
the aptitude,&mdash;the members of the committee for <i>La R&eacute;novation
Sociale par le Travail</i> pledge themselves to spread these ideas
by every means in their power,&mdash;by the pen, by word, and by
example.&#8221;</p>

<p>This group is at present preparing a f&ecirc;te, to be held in the
fall of 1904, for the &#8220;glorification of all the innovators to whom
humanity is indebted for advancement along the line of integral
emancipation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>No&euml;l Humaine</i> (Human Christmas) is celebrated
annually by another group of emancipated men of letters, under
the auspices of Victor Charbonnel&#8217;s journal, <i>La Raison</i>.</p>

<p>The revolutionary fervour of a considerable portion of the intellectual
<i>&eacute;lite</i> has found further expression during the last ten years
in a score or more of reviews (&#8221;<i>jeunes revues</i>&#8221; or &#8220;<i>revues des
jeunes</i>&#8221;) &#8220;which,&#8221; says Paul Adam, &#8220;have created, promulgated,
sustained, and caused to triumph almost two-thirds of the ideas
upon which the new century is beginning its life.&#8221; &#8220;In each,&#8221;
says the same writer, &#8220;a group of disinterested spirits, extraordinarily
erudite, indifferent to success and fortune, eager for knowledge
and proud in its acquisition, have cultivated the most
beautiful garden of mentality which has been seen in France since
the Pl&eacute;&iuml;ade and Port-Royal. Poets, sociologists, romancers, and
critics have disseminated thereby marvellous beauties.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Adam exaggerates, as he is very apt to do. Nevertheless,
in spite of a great deal that is immature, amateurish, intemperate,
and fantastic about most of them, the <i>revues des jeunes</i> are one
of the most significant phenomena of these latter years.</p>

<p>They have been an appreciable disturbing force. The names
of most of the writers mentioned in this chapter are repeatedly
appearing in their tables of contents; and their prospectuses
abound in such tell-tale phrases as these: &#8220;<i>art libre</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>beaut&eacute;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
sociale</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>vie f&eacute;conde et humanit&eacute; forte</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>d&eacute;voiler les intrigues</i>,
<i>combattre les abus</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>tribune ouverte</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>id&eacute;es hardies et g&eacute;n&eacute;reuses</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>l&#8217;&acirc;me purement d&eacute;sint&eacute;ress&eacute;e des futurs Etats-Unis
d&#8217;Europe</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>l&#8217;art existe pour la vie</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>la cit&eacute; radieuse o&ugrave; l&#8217;humanit&eacute;
affranchie vivra enfin dans l&#8217;harmonie, dans la justice, et dans la
force</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Furthermore, such publications as <i>Le Mercure de France</i>, <i>La
Grande Revue</i> (edited by Fernand Labori, defender of anarchists
and of Dreyfus), <i>La Plume</i> (whose <i>soir&eacute;es litt&eacute;raires</i> have enjoyed
an international renown), <i>La Revue de Paris</i>, <i>La Revue</i>, <i>La Contemporaine</i>,
<i>La Vogue</i>, <i>L&#8217;Hermitage</i>, and <i>La Grande France</i>, by
extending the hospitality of their columns to the exploitation of
the most advanced theories and ideas, have&mdash;without claiming
to be revolutionary or, at any rate, without limiting themselves to
propaganda&mdash;effectively supplemented the efforts of the propagandist
mediums.</p>

<p>The revolutionary sentiments prevalent among the intellectual
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of France have found abundant expression in the French
drama, as was to be expected in a country which has a literary
stage and in which nearly every man of letters is something of
a playwright. Indeed, it would not be surprising if the stage,
by reason of its superior capacity for giving vividness to ideas,
were quite as efficacious an instrument of revolutionary propaganda
as the press, the <i>chanson</i>, or the novel.</p>

<p>Octave Mirbeau is the author of several plays, three of which,
<i>Les Mauvais Bergers</i>, <i>L&#8217;Epid&eacute;mie</i>, and <i>L&#8217;Acquitt&eacute;</i>, teem with
caustic, uncompromising anarchism.</p>

<p><i>Les Mauvais Bergers</i> was successfully produced by Bernhardt&#8217;s
company in 1897. Its hero, Jean Roule, is a young,
thoughtful, aspiring workman, who has suffered so much at the
hands of the capitalists and the authorities and has seen so
much suffering imposed on others from the same sources that
he is possessed with a colossal, implacable hatred of everybody
and everything that has to do with power. On the other hand,
his heart is full to bursting with unselfish love for the unfortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
proletariat. &#8220;I want to live,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;to live in my flesh, in my
brain, in the expansion of all my organs, of all my faculties, instead
of remaining the beast of burden that is flogged and the unthinking
machine that is turned for others. I want to be a man,
in short,&mdash;a man in my own eyes.... We also need some poetry
and some art in our lives; for, poor as he may be, a man does not
live by bread alone. He has a right, like the rich, to things of
beauty.... These flames, this smoke, these tortures, these
accursed machines which every day and every hour devour my
brain, my heart, my right to happiness, my right to life,&mdash;these&mdash;these
yawning mouths of ovens, these fiery furnaces, these caldrons
which are fed with my muscles, with my will, with my liberty,
by the shovelful,&mdash;to make out of them the wealth and the social
puissance of a single man! Extinguish all that, I entreat you!
Blow up all that! Annihilate all that!&#8221;</p>

<p>His most complete abhorrence is the politician. The employer
is white beside him. &#8220;The employer is a man, like you.
You have him before you. You speak to him, you move him,
you threaten him, you kill him! At least, he has a visage,&mdash;a
chest in which to sink a knife. But go move this being without
a visage called politician! Go kill this thing called politics,&mdash;this
slimy, slippery thing which you think you hold and which
always escapes you, which you believe dead and which always
comes to life again,&mdash;this abominable thing by which everything
has been debased, everything corrupted, everything bought,
everything sold,&mdash;justice, love, beauty!&mdash;which has made venality
of conscience a national institution of France; which has done
worse still, since with its filthy slaver it has befouled the august
face of the poor! worse still, since it has destroyed in you your
last ideal,&mdash;faith in Revolution!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aided and inspirited by a working-girl, Madeleine (Bernhardt&#8217;s
r&ocirc;le), this Jean Roule, who would kill as much from excess
of love as from hate, leads the workmen in a revolt against their
employers. But the latter are sustained by government troops,
and the play ends with a massacre and a procession of coffins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p><i>L&#8217;Epid&eacute;mie</i> (1898) is an extravagant one-act comedy,&mdash;almost
a farce,&mdash;caricaturing the culpable indifference of the bourgeois
politician to the welfare of the humble and his extreme solicitude
for the welfare of the rich. Typhoid fever has made several
victims in the military barracks of a provincial city. The municipal
council assembles for the purpose of taking measures to arrest
it. When the council learns, however, that the disease has
attacked no one outside the barracks, and within the barracks
only the private soldiers, whose duty, whose glory it is to give
their lives for their country, it decides to do nothing, to the accompaniment
of enthusiastic cries of &#8220;<i>Vive la France!</i>&#8221; The decision
has scarcely been made when a messenger arrives with
the news that a bourgeois has died of the plague. Thereupon
the council reconsiders its former action, votes to erect a statue
to the dead bourgeois, to name a street in his honour, to demolish
the city&#8217;s unsanitary quarters, to open up boulevards, and to introduce
a water system, and makes an appropriation of 100,000,000
francs therefor. Finally, each councillor rises in turn,
and pronounces a panegyric of the bourgeois victim.</p>

<p><i>L&#8217;Acquitt&eacute;</i>, another one-act comedy, presents the adventure
of a vagabond, Jean Guenille, who, having carried to the police
station (in an access of honesty) a purse of 10,000 francs which
he found in the street, is browbeaten and put under lock and
key by the <i>commissaire</i> because he has no legal domicile. M.
Mirbeau&#8217;s other plays, <i>Vieux M&eacute;nages</i> (1900), <i>Le Portefeuille</i>
and <i>Scrupules</i> (1902), and <i>Les Affaires sont les Affaires</i> (1903),&mdash;the
last-named<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> an exposition of the power of money to destroy
natural sentiments,&mdash;are only a shade less subversive in tone.</p>

<p>Lucien Descaves has to his credit a one-act anarchistic play,
entitled <i>La Cage</i>. The Havenne family (consisting of father,
mother, a son Albert, aged twenty-one, and a daughter Madeleine,
aged twenty-six), threatened with eviction and unable
to pay their rent or find work, are in black despair. The father
and mother, in the temporary absence of Albert and Madeleine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
drink a vial of laudanum and light a brazier of charcoal. The
children return, find their parents dead, and, desiring to die likewise,
submit themselves to the poisonous fumes of the brazier,
which is still burning. They bethink themselves in time, however,
decide that it is less cowardly to steal than to die, and set
out together for a career of outlawry and revolutionary apostleship.
&#8220;Are we quite sure, Madeleine, that there is nothing better
to do than to kill ourselves?&#8221; queries Albert. And then he
quotes the famous letter of Frederick of Prussia to D&#8217;Alembert:
&#8220;If there should be found a family destitute of all resources
and in the frightful condition you depict, I should not hesitate
to decide theft legitimate.... The ties of society are based
upon reciprocal services; but, if this society is composed of pitiless
souls, all engagements are broken.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>La Cage</i> was suppressed by the censorship<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> very early in its
career. Descaves, who dedicated his work &#8220;<i>Aux d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;s
pour qu&#8217;ils choisissent</i>,&#8221; foresaw and publicly predicted its interdiction.
&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to put on the stage, instead
of adulteries and embarrassing <i>liaisons</i>, the distress of a bourgeois
family at the end of its resources, its illusions, and its courage,&mdash;the
parents reduced to suicide and the children precipitated
into revolt. Ah! you&#8217;ll hear a fine clatter!&#8221;</p>

<p>The severity of the censorship towards <i>La Cage</i> called out
numerous protests, notably this from Alexander Hepp (in his
<i>Quotidiens</i>), little suspected of doctrinal sympathy with Descaves:
&#8220;As soon as we show to the gallery the reality of the miseries,
the despairs, the injustices of society, a fragment of real life,
of the true cross people carry, our delicate sensibilities are shocked;
and it is always before that which is truest that we cry out improbability.
The innovating tendencies, the harsh accent of
retribution, the virile sincerity of Descaves, who puts on the
boards a family driven to suicide, have disturbed the digestions
of the orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<p>The critic Henri Bauer, commenting on <i>Les Mauvais Bergers</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
and <i>La Cage</i>, wrote: &#8220;An anti-social dramatic literature is born
in France.... It required authors of the power and eloquence
of Mirbeau, of the devouring passion and the admirable soul of
Descaves, to dare to ring out in dramatic dialogue this conclusion,
<i>On n&#8217;am&eacute;liore pas la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, on la supprime</i>.... Society is a lie,
social progress a lure, the social pact is broken: nothing is left
but the individual,&mdash;his temperament, his law, his conscience,
and his will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Descaves&#8217; <i>Tiers Etat</i> is an eloquent plea for the faithful mistress
who is debarred from marriage by legal technicalities. He
is also joint author with Georges Darien of <i>Les Chapons</i> (to which
this legend was prefixed: &#8220;<i>Aux M&acirc;nes des Bourgeois de Calais
nous sacrifions ce sp&eacute;cimen de leur pitoyable descendance</i>&#8221;), and
with Maurice Donnay of <i>La Clairi&egrave;re</i> and <i>Oiseaux de Passage</i>.
<i>La Clairi&egrave;re</i>, which was one of the notable features of the theatrical
season of 1898-99, pictures the life of an anarchist <i>phalanst&egrave;re</i>,
which succeeds admirably until the members send for their
<i>compagnes</i>, when it is demoralised and disintegrated by petty
intrigues and jealousies.</p>

<p>The moral? Not the obvious and absurd one that men alone
will constitute the society of the future; but this, that women have
not been enfranchised long enough to have developed the maturity
of character necessary to the practice of anarchist precepts.
<i>Oiseaux de Passage</i> deals with the experiences of anarchists in
exile. &#8220;I am proud,&#8221; says M. Descaves, apropos of the piece,
&#8220;to have been able to transfer to the stage the theories of a
Bakounine, and to introduce them to the public thus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice Donnay is a railing nihilist, subtle, graceful, and gracious,
somewhat after the Anatole France pattern,&mdash;a smiling
<i>r&eacute;volt&eacute;</i>, a refined recalcitrant, whose recipe for a play is said to
be &#8220;a little love, much adultery, an enormous amount of <i>esprit</i>,
a pinch of politics, and a gramme of sociology,&#8221; and whose psychology
is &#8220;a sparkling, effervescing affair, the analyses of which
explode merrily with the welcome noise of popping champagne
corks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Amants</i>, <i>La Douloureuse</i>, <i>La Bascule</i>, <i>Le Retour de J&eacute;rusalem</i>,
and <i>Georgette Lemonnier</i>, Donnay is prodigal of <i>bons mots</i>
and malicious pleasantries, by which he gives the most piquant
conceivable flavour to the social and political infamies of the time.
<i>Le Torrent</i>, his most ambitious work, has this much of the serious,
that death is its d&eacute;nouement; but its general method and
attitude do not differ essentially from the method and attitude
of his other plays.</p>

<p>To those who expressed surprise that the flippant Donnay
should collaborate with the truculent Descaves, Donnay himself
said: &#8220;A young man, I produced at the <i>Chat Noir</i> my piece
<i>Pension de Famille</i>, which won me the honour of being called &#8216;joyous
anarchist&#8217; by Jules Lema&icirc;tre. I remained an anarchist in
<i>La Douloureuse</i>. And, without doubt, I have always been an
anarchist; more, it is true, for sentimental than for sociological
reasons, but also from a point of view exclusively philosophical.
He who analyses, he who, without ceasing, unravels the meshes
of this complicated network of ideas which constitutes the social
order, is more or less of an anarchist necessarily, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Other works of unequivocal revolt produced within the last
fifteen years are:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mais Quelqu&#8217;un Troubla la F&ecirc;te</i>,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> a one-act piece by Louis
Marsolleau. A financier, a politician, a bishop, a general, a
judge, a duchess, and a courtesan (so many types of the powerful
and privileged of the world) partake hilariously of a sumptuous
banquet. Their revels are interrupted by the apparition first
of a peasant, then of a city labourer, and are finally put an end
to by a mysterious and terrible unknown, who causes a general
explosion.</p>

<p><i>Sur la Foi des Etoiles</i>, by Gabriel Trarieux,&mdash;an esoteric symbolistic
effort, a groping towards the society of the future: &#8220;I
say to myself: The stars up yonder, with their fixed, impassive
air, the stars which have mounted guard for centuries, are living
worlds.... They die and are born. I compare them to the truths
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
which guide us.... For there are several truths,&mdash;... some very
ancient, almost extinguished, to which we submit by force of
habit, and some&mdash;oh! just emerging&mdash;which will not be true
before to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Le Cuivre</i>, by Paul Adam and Andr&eacute; Picard, which exposes
and explains the tyranny exercised by money over persons and
governments; and <i>L&#8217;Automne</i>, by Paul Adam and Gabriel Mourey
(forbidden by the censorship).</p>

<p><i>Le Domaine</i>, by Lucien Besnard, which recounts the progress
of socialism in the rural districts, and defines the antagonism between
the decadent nobility and the rising fourth estate.</p>

<p><i>La P&acirc;que Socialiste</i>, by Emile Veyrin, which describes a practical
experiment in Christian socialism.</p>

<p><i>La Sape</i>, by Georges Leneven, the hero of which is an anarchist
dreamer of a highly intellectual type, <i>Le D&eacute;tour</i> by Henry
Bernstein, and <i>Le Masque</i> by Henri Bataille.</p>

<p><i>Le Voile du Bonheur</i>, by Georges Clemenceau, which employs
Chinese personages and a Chinese setting to explain the
manner in which Frenchmen are fooled and ruled by their &#8220;mandarins&#8221;;
and <i>Les Petits Pieds</i> by Henry de Saussine, which employs
a similar device to ridicule French education.</p>

<p><i>Le Ressort: Etude de R&eacute;volution</i>, mystic and ominous, by Urbain
Gohier; <i>Barbapoux</i>, savagely anti-clerical, by Charles Malato;
<i>En D&eacute;tresse</i>, with a conclusion akin to that of Descaves&#8217;
<i>Cage</i>, by Henri F&egrave;vre; <i>L&#8217;Ami de l&#8217;Ordre</i>, by Georges Darien;
<i>La Gr&egrave;ve</i>, by Jean Hugues; <i>Conte de No&euml;l</i> and <i>Des Cloches du
Cain</i>, by Auguste Linert; <i>Le Chemineau</i>, by Richepin; Jean

pieces of H&eacute;rold, Pierre Valdagne, and Georges Lecomte.</p>

<p>These performances have been supplemented by revivals of
De Maupassant&#8217;s <i>Boule de Suif</i>, which portrays the sacrifice
made by a prostitute for the bourgeois and her ostracism by them
when they have no further need of her assistance; of the stage
version of Zola&#8217;s <i>Germinal</i> in the theatres of the working faubourgs;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
and of certain precursors, such as Henri Becque&#8217;s <i>Les Corbeaux</i>
(probably the most terrible arraignment of law and lawyers ever
written) and <i>L&#8217;Evasion</i> and <i>La R&eacute;volte</i> of Villiers de l&#8217;Isle-Adam;
and by the importation of the principal works of the Russian,
Belgian, Scandinavian, German, Italian, and Spanish innovators.</p>

<p>Alfred Capus, the principal rival of Maurice Donnay in his
peculiar <i>genre</i>, holds in completest but most amiable detestation
whatever has to do with regular living. Less sardonic than M.
Donnay, lighter, brighter, and more <i>spirituel</i>, if that is possible,
he is equally nihilistic, though not, so far as I am aware,
by personal avowal. In <i>Rosine</i> he ventures to depict a <i>union
libre</i> receiving a father&#8217;s benediction; and in <i>Qui Perd Gagne</i>,
<i>Ann&eacute;es d&#8217;Aventures</i>, <i>Les Petites Folles</i>, <i>Mariage Bourgeois</i>, <i>La
Veine</i>, <i>La Bourse ou la Vie</i>, and <i>Beau Jeune Homme</i> he holds
up to ridicule, one after another, all the traditional bourgeois
ideals.</p>

<p>Reformers being notoriously deficient in the sense of humour,
it is a curious and piquant circumstance that not only a majority
of the brilliant school of stage humourists, currently known
as the &#8220;<i>Auteurs Gais</i>,&#8221; but the four most admired of the group,&mdash;Georges
Court&eacute;line, Pierre Veber, Jules Renard, and Tristan
Bernard,&mdash;are frankly revolutionary, either in their personal
opinions or in their writings, or in both.</p>

<p>Pierre Veber and Tristan Bernard were charter members of
the revolutionary band <i>L&#8217;Endehors</i>, and have been affiliated latterly
with that of <i>L&#8217;Id&eacute;e Nouvelle</i>. Jules Renard is the bitterest
of social philosophers, under the thin disguise of a charming,
impeccable style.</p>

<p>Court&eacute;line, whose comic genius is so strong, so pure, and so
fine that he is called, without too gross exaggeration, &#8220;<i>le petit-fils
de Moli&egrave;re</i>&#8221;; Court&eacute;line, who will be read and played, in the
opinion of many, long after every other contemporary French
dramatist has been forgotten; Court&eacute;line, who makes you laugh
till you weep over what you ought to weep over without laughing,
who promotes reflection and rouses the conscience while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
dispelling melancholy,&mdash;this prodigious Court&eacute;line, truth-loving
joker and humane mountebank as he is, has probably done more
than any single individual in any sphere to bring into disrepute
the brutality of the army, and to expose the perpetual contradiction
between essential justice and the texts of the law.</p>

<p>Eug&egrave;ne Brieux is the most prolific producer of the &#8220;<i>pi&egrave;ce &agrave;
th&egrave;se sociale</i>&#8221; and the most indefatigable corrector of abuses
connected with the Paris stage. He has attacked the race-course
and the police station in <i>Le R&eacute;sultat des Courses</i>, public and
private charity in <i>Les Bienfaiteurs</i>, physicians in <i>L&#8217;Evasion</i>,
current methods of instruction in <i>Blanchette</i>, popular ignorance
of and prejudice against venereal diseases in <i>Les Avari&eacute;s</i>,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> the
law and the administrators of the law in <i>La Robe Rouge</i> (&#8221;<i>C&#8217;est
donc la loi qui rend criminel?</i>&#8221;), and the Chamber of Deputies
in <i>L&#8217;Engrenage</i>; and he has defended the rights of children against
parents in <i>Le Berceau</i>, the rights of the artistic temperament
in <i>M&eacute;nages d&#8217;Artistes</i>, the rights of the poor against the rich in
<i>Les Rempla&ccedil;antes</i>, and the rights of the <i>fille-m&egrave;re</i> in <i>Maternit&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>M. Brieux is not easy to locate doctrinally or otherwise. He
is not an &#8220;<i>auteur gai</i>,&#8221; far from it, and is not, in the strict sense
of the term, perhaps, a revolutionist. But his mania for the
correction of abuses has surely beguiled him more than once
into an attitude towards society that is, to all intents and purposes,
revolutionary.</p>

<p>The rugged, poetic, weird, and philosophical Fran&ccedil;ois de Curel
is as difficult to locate doctrinally as M. Brieux. There are times
when he seems to be as irreverent a nihilist as M. France, M.
Donnay, or M. Richepin, and times when he seems to be as reverently
ecclesiastical and reactionary as M. Paul Bourget or M.
le Comte de Mun. All his plays&mdash;<i>Les Fossiles</i>, in which he pictures
the pathetic impotence of the exhausted nobility; <i>La Nouvelle
Idole</i>, in which he alternately exalts and belittles science;
<i>La Fille Sauvage</i>, in which he studies the demoralising effect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
of civilisation upon the mind of the savage; and <i>Le Repas du
Lion</i>, in which he confronts orthodox economy with the socialist&#8217;s
dream&mdash;admit of different and absolutely contradictory interpretations.</p>

<p>But <i>Le Repas du Lion</i> is claimed, with at least a show of reason,
by the socialists, because of its d&eacute;nouement. One of its wealthy
characters elucidates the conflict between labour and capital
by means of a parable, &#8220;The Lion and the Jackal.&#8221; The lion
hunts for himself. The jackal, too feeble to hunt for himself,
follows the lion. The lion gorges himself with his prey. The
jackal eats what the lion leaves. If there were no lion to hunt
for him, the jackal would starve. Ergo, the lion is the benefactor
of the jackal.</p>

<p>A labourer objects: &#8220;In that case, Monsieur, there is a lion;
and we are the jackals. Since you choose to have the business
settled between wild beasts, we will follow you on to your own
ground. When the jackals find that the remnants left by the
lion do not garnish their paunches sufficiently, they get together
in great numbers, surprise the king, and devour him alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The labourer&#8217;s objection is given force by the shooting of the
capitalist of the piece. &#8220;The reply of the jackal to the lion,&#8221;
comments one of the minor characters.</p>

<p>Jean Jullien considers himself, if rumour speaks true, in no
sense a revolutionist. All the same, his robust drama <i>La Poigne</i>,
which depicts vividly the moral ravages wrought by authority
in and about a humanitarian soul, was received enthusiastically
by both the socialistic and the anarchistic press. &#8220;Socialists
will take notice,&#8221; remarked a socialist organ, &#8220;that it behooves
them to lavish their money and their bravos on this attempt at
&#8216;<i>L&#8217;Art Social</i>.&#8217;&#8221; And the theatrical critic of <i>Le Libertaire</i> said:
&#8220;The piece of Jean Jullien pleased us by its frankness and its
human interest. Rarely has an author so stirred our minds and
hearts. It is only just to say that the personages exemplify
the sentiments and the ideas which are familiar to the anarchists,
and that we find in <i>La Poigne</i> an echo of our passions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>The same author&#8217;s <i>L&#8217;Ecoli&egrave;re</i>, which denounces the hypocrisy
of petty provincial functionaries and narrates the conflict of a
high-minded, warm-hearted woman with the bourgeois system
of morals, was accorded a similar welcome in similar quarters. So
also was his <i>Oasis</i>, which preaches that Humanity should create
for itself, remote from &#8220;egoisms, prejudices, mutually hostile religions,
and the disgraceful tumults of injustice and war, the
basis of peace, of association, and of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a <i>f&eacute;ministe</i> who flouts and defies the marriage code, Paul
Hervieu lays himself liable to be classed as a revolutionist, at
least a partial revolutionist, however little such a classification
may please him. Whatever else they are, <i>La Loi de l&#8217;Homme</i>,
<i>L&#8217;Armature</i>, <i>Les Tenailles</i>, <i>Les Paroles Restent</i>, <i>L&#8217;Enigme</i>, and
<i>Le D&eacute;dale</i> are works of revolt. The first-named, <i>La Loi de
l&#8217;Homme</i>, evoked the following sweeping but not unsympathetic
judgment from the critic Emile de St. Auban, who, lawyer as
well as critic, should know whereof he speaks: &#8220;The contemporary
theatre occupies itself a great deal with the laws. The code
appears often on the boards, and the dramatist-jurists abrogate
it in prose or in verse. But never was this abrogation so passionate,
so brusque, never was it so radical, so total, as in <i>La Loi
de l&#8217;Homme</i>. I will add so concise, since three very short acts,
two of which make one, suffice to erase not a text, but <i>the</i> text,
not <i>a</i> law, but <i>the</i> law, and with the law the cort&egrave;ge of egoisms
and hypocrisies which have given it birth, and have assured it its
full expansion and the calm and sure perpetration of its outrages;
to erase, I say, an entire jurisprudence, written or traditional,
promulgated against the weak for the strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the category of partial, unwilling, or unwitting revolutionists
to which Jullien, Brieux, Hervieu, and De Curel belong may
be assigned also Jules Case in <i>La Vassale</i>, Gaston D&eacute;vore in
<i>La Conscience d&#8217;un Enfant</i>, Georges Ancey in <i>Ces Messieurs</i>
and <i>La Dupe</i>, Emile Fabre in <i>L&#8217;Argent</i>, <i>Le Bien d&#8217;Autrui</i>, <i>La
Vie Publique</i>, and <i>Comme Ils sont Tous</i>, Rostand in <i>La Samaritaine</i>,
Abel Hermant in <i>Le Faubourg</i>, <i>La Carri&egrave;re</i>, and <i>La Meute</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Albert Guinon in <i>D&eacute;cadence</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Alexandre Bisson in <i>Le Bon Juge</i>,
Emile Bourgeois in <i>Mariage d&#8217;Argent</i>, and Bruyerre in <i>En
Paix</i>. Indeed, it is even permitted to query whether the reputed
reactionaries, Jules Lema&icirc;tre and Henri Lavedan, are not
really (at least so far as certain of their pieces are concerned)
in the same boat.</p>

<p>Revolutionary and semi-revolutionary plays were for a considerable
period well-nigh a monopoly of the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre</i>,
where unconditional literary form and unconventional acting were
the handmaids of unconventional ideas. Latterly they have
invaded every legitimate stage of Paris, not excepting the august
and supposedly inhospitable <i>Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise</i>; and they may
be said to be the specialty of four houses: the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Antoine</i>
(founded by Antoine after he abandoned the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre</i>); the
<i>Grand Guignol</i>, the nearest existing counterpart to the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Libre</i>; and the <i>Gymnase</i> and the <i>Renaissance</i>, which are now copying
the general policy of the <i>Antoine</i>. Maurice Maeterlinck
and his company have latterly made their headquarters in Paris.
Maeterlinck&#8217;s <i>Monna Vanna</i> was applauded by the revolutionary
organs.</p>

<p>The various free stages, or <i>th&eacute;&acirc;tres &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute;</i>, which give private
performances at irregular intervals, also reserve a modicum of
space in their r&eacute;pertoires for pieces of social revolt.</p>

<p>The <i>revues</i> of the variety theatres and concert halls, in which
the events of the year are criticised and caricatured with a freedom
that often calls down the wrath of the censorship, particularly
at Montmartre, are also far from a negligible influence in
the direction of revolution.</p>

<p class="quote">In 1883 the socialist Clovis Hugues wrote, in an introduction
to a volume by the refractory L&eacute;on Cladel: &#8220;The petrification
of the republic in the bourgeois spirit does not prevent literature
from being socialistic. It is unconsciously so, perhaps; but it
is so. And this is the essential thing for the future.... Open
a romance, no matter what one, attend a theatrical representation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
no matter what one, and, so that you have the slightest
aptitude for combining details, for surprising the idea in the fact,
for following a philosophical train through an intrigue, you will
be amazed at the quantity of socialism which emerges from this
romance and that play. Has the author felt himself responsible
towards the Revolution in writing his work? Not the least in
the world. He has yielded to the mighty pressure of events, he
has submitted to the historic fatalities of his time, the permanent
influence of humanity in travail.... What signifies this transformation?
It signifies that the philosophies soak down into
literature; it signifies that the hour is at hand, since the idea incarnates
itself involuntarily in the form; it signifies that the fourth
estate is mounting, that justice is near.&#8221;</p>

<p>A round decade later (1894) A. Hamon, a friend of anarchy,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Read in the sheets which are the most hostile to the anarchists&mdash;such
as the <i>Figaro</i>, the <i>Journal</i>, the <i>Gil Blas</i>, the <i>Echo
de Paris</i>&mdash;the short stories, sketches, and chroniques of the Mirbeaus,
the Bauers, the Descaves, the Paul Adams, the Bernard
Lazares, the Ajalberts, the S&eacute;v&eacute;rines, etc., and you will perceive
that anarchist tendencies throng them. Follow the &#8216;<i>jeunes
revues</i>,&#8217; and you will observe that there is not, to speak in the
large, a piece of verse, a story, a study of any sort whatsoever,
which does not tend towards the destruction of what the anarchists
qualify as social prejudice,&mdash;<i>la patrie</i>, authority, family,
religion, courts of law, militarism, etc.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;All the thinking men of this epoch,&mdash;savants, litt&eacute;rateurs, artists,
etc.,&mdash;one may almost say all, so rare are those who imprison
themselves in the &#8216;<i>tour d&#8217;ivoire</i>&#8217; or who profess doctrines commendatory
of the existing order,&mdash;all the relatively young men,
I mean, who have attained their majority since 1870, have <i>libertaire</i>
inclinations. The result is a fervent propaganda under
the most varied forms and in the most dissimilar <i>milieux</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still later (1899) a declared opponent of anarchism, M. Fierens-Gevaert,
wrote in his admirable social study, <i>La Tristesse Contemporaine</i>:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
&#8220;There are, to begin with, the militant anarchists,&mdash;a
handful of wretched starvelings and lunatics, whose doctrine
consists solely in listening to the instincts of the brute within them.
There are, next, the unwitting or dilettante anarchists. These
latter are legion. They are to be found in the highest grades
of society. They even compose the intellectual <i>&eacute;lite</i> of their
time. Every philosopher, novelist, poet, dramatist, and artist
is to-day a latent anarchist; and very often he boasts of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just how far this surprising situation is an heirloom of the four
revolutions which France traversed during the last century, and
just how far it is traceable to forces which have entered from without,&mdash;to
Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, Darwin and Spencer,
Leopardi and the pleiades of Russian and Scandinavian innovators,&mdash;it
is not necessary to determine. The really significant
thing is that the intellectual and social conditions which have
produced Anatole France, Descaves, and Mirbeau in France have
likewise produced Bj&ouml;rnson, Brand&egrave;s, and Strindberg in Scandinavia,
Maxim Gorky in Russia, Hermann Heijermanns in the
Netherlands, Gerhardt Hauptmann in Germany, Camille Lemonnier
in Belgium, Gabriel d&#8217;Annunzio in Italy, and Jos&eacute; Echegaray
in the Biscayan Peninsula; and it is only by keeping well in mind
the intensity and the scope of this world-movement of revolt that
the dynamic value of French revolt can be properly estimated.</p>

c&#8217;est un po&egrave;te.</i>&#8221; Conversely, the poet is more

quoted by the <i>libertaires</i> in support of their position. &AElig;schylus,

<p>At the same epoch, Alfred de Vigny distilled bitterness against
society in his <i>Destin&eacute;es</i> and <i>Journal d&#8217;un Po&egrave;te</i>; and Leconte de

<p>Victor Hugo&#8217;s <i>Ch&acirc;timents</i> (destined to become the favourite
reading of Caserio, the assassin of Carnot) was the supreme cry
of revolt of the Second Empire. In such lines as these Hugo
proclaimed the anarchist ideal without, however, recognising it
as such:&mdash;</p>

<p>Eug&egrave;ne Vermesch was the fiercest, though by no means the
greatest, poet of the Commune. Laurent Tailhade and Jean
Richepin, among the living, have achieved renown as poets of
revolt.</p>

Like them, he commits himself to nothing and credits nothing, not
even the faiths and formulas of revolution; and, like them, he is
nevertheless a formidable revolutionist.</p>

<p>In the introduction to <i>Les Blasph&egrave;mes</i> he proclaims his intention
of &#8220;scandalising the devout, the Deists, the sceptics,
the materialists, the scientists, the worshippers of Reason, the
prosperous and the unprosperous, in a word, the rout of fools
and hypocrites who fancy it their duty to save Law, Property,
the Family, Society, Morals, etc.&#8221; &#8220;In the defence of these
conventions, of which I do not recognise the binding force,&#8221;
he adds, &#8220;I shall hear all the geese of the Capital clack.&#8221;</p>

them in the most cavalier fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>For his <i>Chansons des Gueux</i>, Richepin was fined five hundred
francs (and costs) and kept in prison thirty days. In this volume
he acclaims all the outlaws and outcasts, all the flotsam and
jetsam of modern civilisation in both country and town,&mdash;thieves,
tramps, gypsies, beggars, thugs, drunkards, foundlings, panders,
and prostitutes; &#8220;the halt, the maimed, the blind,&#8221; the reckless,
the defiant, and the scoffing, the uncontrolled and the uncontrollable,
with a vigour of language, a genuineness of accent, a picturesqueness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
of phrase, an audacity in imagery and epithet, a
poignancy of emotion, a naturalness, a freshness, a breeziness,
or rather a tempestuousness, that bespeak the master. He lays
bare the thoughts and the passions of his disreputable personages,
portrays their starvation and their gluttonies, their enforced abstinences
and their debaucheries, and makes them speak in their
own weird tongues, sing their own ribald songs, and dance their
own maddening dances. For lyric savagery and savage lyrism
these <i>Chansons des Gueux</i> have no counterpart, so far as I know,
in modern literature.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I love my heroes, my lamentable vagabonds,&#8221; wrote Richepin,
in an extraordinary preface.... &#8220;I love this something,
I know not what it is, which renders them beautiful, noble, this
wild-beast instinct which drives them into adventure,&mdash;a rash
and sinister instinct, granted, but an instinct characterised by
a fierce independence. Oh, the marvellous fable of La Fontaine
about the wolf and the dog! The errant wolf is mere skin
and bones. The dog is fat and sleek. Yes, but the chafed
neck, the collar! To be tied! &#8216;So you can&#8217;t run when you wish?
No? Good-bye, then, to your free meals. To the wood! To
the wood! Everything at the point of the sword!&#8217; And Master
Wolf is off: he runs still. He runs still, and will always run, this
wolf, this tramp; and I love him for it. And every soul a bit
above the common will love likewise this voluntary pariah,
who may be repugnant, hideous, odious, abominable, but who
has greatness,&mdash;a superb greatness, since his whole being voices
the heroic war-cry of Tacitus: <i>Malo periculosam libertatem</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Periculosam!</i> my brave vagabonds! <i>Periculosam!</i> do you
hear, you coddled worldlings, all of you who have your soup and
your kennel&mdash;and also your collar? Have I then committed
a great crime in revealing the brutal poetry of these adventurers,
of these braves, of these stubborn children to whom society is
almost always a stepmother, and who, finding no milk in the
breast of the unnatural nurse, bite the flesh itself to calm their
hunger?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<p>Laurent Tailhade is a less natural and wholesome poet than
Jean Richepin, perhaps, but he is certainly a more distinguished
one. As a chiseller of poetic cameos and medallions, he has
few, if any, superiors among his contemporaries. His <i>Vitraux</i>
and <i>Jardin des R&ecirc;ves</i> are particularly relished by artists and
litt&eacute;rateurs and by his brother-poets.</p>

<p>Tailhade&#8217;s prose is as finely chiselled as his poetry. It is almost
invariably lyric; and&mdash;although he is caustic and cruel
therein to the verge of cut-throatism, and although he has at his
command the most extensive vocabulary of invective of any person
in France, not excepting M. Henri Rochefort&mdash;it is always,
like his poetry, distinguished. His cult for the classic French
and Latin authors and his scrupulous care for art save him
from vulgarity and commonplaceness, even in his most questionable
literary undertakings and even in the simple diatribes which
he contributes to the most insignificant, the least scholarly, and
the least artistic propagandist sheets. &#8220;He is a <i>lettr&eacute;</i>,&#8221; says M.
Ledrain, conservator at the Louvre, &#8220;who knows admirably
his Latin and his Sixteenth Century, and who has formed thus
a particularly savoury style which we all admire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tailhade has unblenchingly defended nearly every anarchist
attempt that has occurred in Europe since he came to manhood.
He characterised the assassination of Humbert by the Italian
Bresci as &#8220;<i>un geste qui console et qui revive nos espoirs</i>&#8221;; and
Sophie Perowska&iuml;a, Hartmann, Rysakoff, Caserio, Angiolillo,
Henry, and Ravachol were all eulogised by him. He has been
prominently before the public on four occasions during the past
decade: at the time of the attempt of Vaillant, by reason of his
striking epigram, &#8220;<i>Qu&#8217;importe le reste, si le geste est beau</i>&#8221;; a
little later, when he was himself the victim, at the <i>Restaurant
Foyot</i>, of an anarchist&mdash;or anti-anarchist?&mdash;<i>beau geste</i> which
nearly cost him his eyesight and permanently disfigured him;
in the autumn of 1901, at the time of the second visit of the
czar, when he was tried and sentenced to a 1,000-franc fine
and a year&#8217;s imprisonment for having reaffirmed &#8220;the venerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
theory of regicide<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> which has traversed history&#8221; in a remarkable
prose poem published by <i>Le Libertaire</i>, and entitled &#8220;<i>Le
Triomphe de la Domesticit&eacute;</i>&#8221;; and lastly, in 1903, when he was
mobbed in Brittany for his diatribes against the local clergy,
on which occasion he rendered himself ludicrously guilty of inconsistency
by appealing to the protection of the police.</p>

<p>The incriminated passage in &#8220;<i>Le Triomphe de la Domesticit&eacute;</i>,&#8221;
above referred to, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<i>Quoi, parmi ces soldats ill&eacute;galement retenus pour veiller sur
la route o&ugrave; va passer la couardise imp&eacute;riale, parmi ces gardes-barri&egrave;res

les mendiants, les trimardeurs, les outlaws, ceux qui meurent de
froid sous les ponts en hiver, d&#8217;insolation en &eacute;t&eacute;, de faim toute la
vie, il ne s&#8217;en trouvera pas un pour prendre son fusil, son tissonnier,
pour arracher aux fr&ecirc;nes des bois le gourdin pr&eacute;historique,
et, montant sur le marchepied des carrosses, pour frapper jusqu&#8217;&agrave;
la mort, pour frapper au visage, et pour frapper au c&oelig;ur la canaille
triomphante, tsar, pr&eacute;sident, ministres, officiers, et les clerg&eacute;s infames,
tous les exploiteurs qui rient de sa mis&egrave;re, vivent de sa moelle,
courbent son &eacute;chine, et le payent de vains mots! La rue de la

<p>At the banquet offered him by sympathising litt&eacute;rateurs and
artists immediately after his trial, Tailhade proposed a toast
which illustrates capitally the scope of his emancipating ardour.
It was:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the course of his trial he expounded his attitude, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I know that I am on trial before you for excitation to murder.
As an author, it is my duty to express all my thought; as an historian,
it is my duty to discuss historic facts; as a philosopher,
I have the right to think and to deduce from these facts the philosophical
consequence which they warrant. I have availed myself
largely of what I consider my right. I accept the entire responsibility
of my acts. I even hold that they do me honour.
If to-morrow an occasion presented itself for me to express
again, in the interests of beauty, all my thought, I should, before
the general baseness, seize with eagerness this fresh occasion.&#8221;</p>

<span class="captionc">CLOVIS HUGUES</span></div>

<p>The <i>raffin&eacute;</i> De Goncourt was wont to dream of an infernal
machine &#8220;<i>tuant la b&ecirc;tise chic qui
de quatre &agrave; six heures fait le tour
du Bois de Boulogne</i>.&#8221; Similarly
it is the Philistinism and vulgar
fetichism of the hour, its imbecility
and ugliness, that particularly exasperate
M. Tailhade, this other
<i>raffin&eacute;</i>, and set scintillating his
scholarly and artistic ire. It was
out of the depths of a profound disgust
that he drew his scorching volume,
<i>Le Pays des Mufles</i>; and it is
the &aelig;sthetic offences quite as much
as the economic misdoings of the
bourgeois that he habitually lashes.</p>

<p>Socialism likewise has its poets,
of whom Clovis Hugues and Maurice
Bouchor (poets considerably
inferior to Richepin and Tailhade)
may be mentioned among the maturer
men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p>Clovis Hugues has as avocation, when the fortune of elections
favours him, the defence of socialistic principles in the Chamber
of Deputies; and M. Bouchor gives a considerable portion of his
time to acquainting working people with the masterpieces of literature.
&#8220;The &aelig;sthetic sense, which is the most elevated means
of enjoyment, being dependent on the regular action of the other
senses,&#8221; says Bouchor, &#8220;we need, if we would assure to all men
a complete development, to demand plenty of material comfort
for every individual. We ought to realise for all humanity the
idea of the old Latin adage,&mdash;<i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>. Thus
socialism, which current prejudice interprets as a negation of art for
art&#8217;s sake, is, on the contrary, the most direct route to it, and the
affirmation of it.... We wish to raise the masses to the noblest
artistic conceptions.... The people have a right to beauty, to
science, to an unutilitarian culture of the mind, to whatever, in
a word, can enlighten and ennoble it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In poetry the relation between freedom of expression and freedom
of thought is a very intimate one. The search for fresh
forms and the thinking of fresh thoughts are very apt to go together.
Furthermore, there would seem to be some subtle affinity
between the releasing of verse from its fetters and the enfranchisement
of humanity from its bondage. It would be puerile
to lay any stress on the fact that both Henry and Vaillant wrote
verses for the <i>revues des jeunes</i>, since this may well have been a
mere coincidence. But it is certain that the agitation for the
<i>vers libre</i> in France these latter years has been one of the manifestations
of the prevalent revolutionary spirit.</p>

<p>True, Verlaine and Mallarm&eacute;, though sufficiently revolutionary
as regards form, were quite the reverse of revolutionary in
their thinking; and plenty of similar instances might be cited.
On the other hand, a large majority of the poets who have fought
the battle for the recognition of the rights of the <i>vers libre</i> have
been imbued, or at least touched, with revolutionary ideas; and
Verlaine, Mallarm&eacute;, and the other poets who remained loyal
to the old society, all in discarding the old verse, were on terms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
of closest intimacy with the revolutionists, and were for a long
time mainly encouraged (not to say &#8220;boomed&#8221;) by them.</p>

<p>Adolphe Rett&eacute; and Gustave Kahn are unblushing anarchists.
The former, who has had in his time more than one misunderstanding
with the law, says of himself and his opinions: &#8220;I fenced,
in the <i>revues</i>, against scholastics of every sort, maintaining that
the artist (by the very fact of his being an artist) should translate
his emotions by an individual rhythm, and not according
to fixed forms.... I set myself to interrogate all the unfortunates
whom I elbowed in this hell [the hospital], worse than that of
Dante.... It was shocking.... And I understood solidarity.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Before entering the hospital, I was a theoretical anarchist.
On leaving it, I was the militant which I hope I have never ceased
to be. I deny and I revolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the members of the revolutionary <i>Endehors</i> group were
advocates of untrammelled verse; and a goodly portion&mdash;among
whom Pierre Quillard, Francis Viel&eacute;-Griffin, and Henri de Regnier
may be mentioned&mdash;were exponents of it.</p>

<p>Quillard is now a militant anarchist at home, and has displayed
on several occasions a chivalrous and more than platonic
enthusiasm for emancipating movements abroad. Viel&eacute;-Griffin
is mildly anarchistic. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;My &aelig;sthetic convictions, which are founded on the axiom,
Art is individualist and normal (that is to say, an artist worthy
of the name carries in his consciousness the necessary rules of
the expression for which he was born, and all dogmas are by
just so much detrimental to art), led me to consider whether the
anarchist doctrines might not have some connection with these
convictions. I am far from having elucidated all the points
which have occupied me up to this moment; but my philosophy,
essentially theistic, welcomes without effort a sort of normal
anarchism, which I am about to discover, perhaps, in the divers
anarchistic works I am consulting.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. de Regnier, recognised in the most reputable quarters,
has practically ceased his commerce with revolutionary spirits.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
But this fact does not in the least impair the significance of the
other fact that he found this commerce conducive, necessary
even, to his proper development in the earlier stages of his career.
Emile Verhaeren, Georges Eekhoud, and several other Belgians
whose art is intimately associated with Paris are, or have been,
poets of revolt.</p>

of the sets of poets, in fact, who have made a stir in the French
world of letters since the disappearance&mdash;as a coterie&mdash;of the
<i>Parnassiens</i>, have included many revolutionists, mostly of anarchistic
bent, protesters as well against the oppressions of politics
and the conventions of society as against the obsession of
stereotyped poetic forms.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The greater part,&#8221; writes one of their number, &#8220;flaunted
proudly their disdain of current prejudices, current morals, and
current institutions.... Some attacked property, religion, family;
others ridiculed marriage and extolled <i>l&#8217;union libre</i>; others vaunted
the blessings of cosmopolitanism and of universal association....
With some, it is true, the antagonism was only apparent,&mdash;simple
love of paradox, inordinate desire to get themselves talked about
by uttering eccentric phrases. But this state of mind existed.
If all did not detest sincerely our bourgeois society, each one
lashed it with violent diatribes, each one had a vague intuition
of something better.&#8221;</p>

or all these things combined,&mdash;it is safe to venture the assertion
that there are, and long have been, in France more revolutionists
of various stripes among the artists than among any other class
of the community engaged in liberal pursuits.</p>

<p>The great Courbet&mdash;to go no farther back&mdash;was a disciple
of Proudhon. &#8220;<i>Il avait</i>,&#8221; to use the picturesque phrase of Jules
Vall&egrave;s, &#8220;<i>du charbon dans le cr&acirc;ne</i>.&#8221; The story of Courbet&#8217;s career
of revolt&mdash;largely mingled with sheer legend, it is true, but even
so scarcely more extraordinary than the reality&mdash;is world property.
Courbet suffered imprisonment for his opinions, and had
his pictures and household effects sold by the state.</p>

<p>Cazin, mildest of painters, was so involved in the Commune
that he was forced to take refuge in London, where he supported
himself by making artistic earthen jars. Eug&egrave;ne Carri&egrave;re, whose
simple, original, eminently human art is slowly conquering two
hemispheres, is an outspoken antagonist of society as it is.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to say whether a majority of the
Impressionists hold (apart from their art, which has proved
profoundly revolutionary) revolutionary views. It is currently
known, however, that Pissarro, Cezanne, and Delattre hold, or
did hold, such views; and the more prominent Neo-Impressionists
have anarchistic leanings almost to a man. As to the social
attitude of Maximilien Luce, Ibels, Paul Signac, Pissarro <i>fils</i>,
F&eacute;lix Vallotton, Francis Jourdain (present managing editor of
<i>Le Libertaire</i>), and Van Rysselberghe, for example, there is no
possibility of dispute.</p>

<p>Luce is the most typical living instance of the artist who is,
as was Courbet, at once a striking figure in the art world and an
influential personality in the revolutionary groups. Born and
brought up in a working faubourg, which he still inhabits, Luce
has an affection as genuine as it is ardent for the common people;
and he has rendered, with disagreeable mannerisms and technical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
lapses, perhaps, but with truth, originality, robustness, and
intensity notwithstanding, two classes of subjects which really
make one,&mdash;the street and working life of Paris and the life of
the lurid mining and smelting regions of Belgium and the north
of France.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Landscapist before everything,&#8221; says Emile Verhaeren,
&#8220;Luce remains faithful to the tendency to sink in nature the
immense strivings of human beings. The surroundings of men
determine their existence and their history. In seeing these
monumental and sinister chimneys and scaffoldings under the
moon, these smoke-clouds which move towards the horizon like
hordes, these fires which tear the night and seem to bleed like
flesh, we think of the tortured humanity of which they express
the suffering. Tracts of desolation and of tragic pangs, miseries
kindled in space, mad vortexes of matter roundabout the voluntary
activity which violates it, which subjugates it, and which
it opposes,&mdash;all anguish and all fear are unveiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul Signac, after Luce and Seurat (deceased) the best known
of the <i>N&eacute;o-Impressionistes</i>, enumerates as follows the influences
which have led him to identify himself with anarchism:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Signac">
<tr>
<td class="right4">&#8220;I.</td>
<td class="left4">The laws of physiology&mdash;the rights of the stomach, of
the brain, of the eyes.</td>

<p>It is certain that there are more revolutionary personalities
in the seceding &#8220;<i>Champ de Mars</i>&#8221; than in the old, and so-called
Official, <i>Salon</i>; and the various coteries of aggressive and often
eccentric innovators, who hold themselves aloof from or are
held aloof by these two salons,&mdash;coteries which correspond vaguely
to the coteries of the <i>jeunes po&egrave;tes</i>,&mdash;display, for the most part,
pronounced revolutionary affinities. The <i>Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants</i>,
whose motto is, &#8220;Neither juries nor awards,&#8221; and whose object
is &#8220;to enable artists to present their works freely to the judgment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of the public, without any outside intervention whatsoever,&#8221;
has been from the beginning an anarchistic salon in every sense
of the term,&mdash;an exhibition by revolutionary artists as well as an
exhibition of revolutionary art. One has only to compare the
names of its exhibitors with the names of those who have co-operated
in the pictorial propaganda of the anarchist organ <i>Les Temps
Nouveaux</i>, to be convinced of it.</p>

<p>It was not necessary that an Edwin Markham should write
a &#8220;Man with a Hoe&#8221; for the world to recognise that the art of
Millet&mdash;whether Millet so intended it or not&mdash;has a social significance.
There are many living painters, about whose social
attitude the public at large knows little or nothing, who, like
Millet (if in less degree), feel and express so well, when they will,
the benumbing influence of poverty, the hardness of the toil, or
the meagreness of the joys of peasants and town labourers, that
this expression is an indirect plea&mdash;no less eloquent than the
most direct plea&mdash;for a redress of social wrongs.</p>

<p>Such, to name only a fraction of those who might be mentioned,
are Besson, Buland, Leclerc, Sabatt&eacute;, L&eacute;on L&#8217;Hermitte, Cottet,
Dauchez, Jean Veber, Zwiller, Geffroy, Boggio, Prunier, Raffaelli,
Luigi Loir, Mlle. Delasalle, Aublet, and Lubin de Beauvais.</p>

<p>Jules Adler, more positive, has given pictorial expression to
the most violent impulses of the mob and the sweeping demands
of labour; and Constantin Meunier<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> has painted, like Luce, the
black and bristling region of the furnaces and the mines described
by Zola in <i>Germinal</i>.</p>

<p>Auguste Rodin, symbolic and synthetic, surely the greatest
innovator in sculpture and probably the greatest sculptor of
the century just closed, has been subjected throughout his career
to a systematic official and academic opposition and persecution,
which have not, so far as I know, made a revolutionist of him,
but which have made him a very god in the eyes of all the revolutionary
elements, and which would have produced the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
effect, perhaps, had his art been far less convincing and colossal
than it is.</p>

<p>Constantin Meunier,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> also an innovator, and second in merit to
Rodin alone according to many, is the sculptor <i>par excellence</i> of the
&#8220;fourth estate.&#8221; The grim and tragic poetry of labour has been
interpreted by him as it had never been interpreted before in
marble and bronze. The special physique, the attitudes and
the gestures, of all the overworked miners, puddlers, fishermen,
and peasants,&mdash;their dignity and their pain, their capacity for
endurance and resentment, their thirst for resistance,&mdash;have in
him a superbly realistic and a compassionate, loving, high-minded,
almost spiritual exponent. Righteous indignation against the
present order of things underlies Meunier&#8217;s work. Indeed, he
makes no secret of his Utopian desires.</p>

<p>Both Meunier and Rodin have elaborated projects for a monument
to the glorification of labour, which are enthusiastically
praised by the champions of social revolt.</p>

<p>Jules Dalou<a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> was banished, like Cazin, for his participation
in the Commune, and was the sculptor of the monuments to the
revolutionists Blanqui and Victor Noir. Baffier is an avowed
revolutionist, who affects the name of artisan and the artisan&#8217;s
garb.</p>

<p>Micheline, the good angel of Emile Veyrin&#8217;s drama <i>La P&acirc;que
Socialiste</i>, says: &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, called the Christ, remained
nailed to a cross six hours. Humanity is on a cross of suffering.
Humanity, the great crucified, will release itself.&#8221; When she
is asked whence she draws her hope, she replies, lifting her eyes
to the cross, &#8220;From the gospel.&#8221; Furthermore, she distributes
the bread of a new covenant to a band of weavers at a symbolic
feast, patterned after the Last Supper. It is at the foot of a
<i>Calvaire</i> that the anarchist Jean Roule, of Mirbeau&#8217;s <i>Mauvais
Bergers</i>, harangues the multitude of striking workmen, who are
for the moment furious against him because he has refused to
accept, in behalf of the strikers, a strike fund offered by certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
professional labour leaders, who intend to utilise the strike for their
own selfish ends; and it is by pointing to the cross&mdash;&#8220;this cross
where for two thousand years, under the weight of miserable
hatreds, He agonises who, the first, dared to speak to men of
liberty and love&#8221;&mdash;that his companion Madeleine, fearing for his
life, transforms their fury into enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Montmartre monologist Jehan Rictus, in &#8220;<i>Le Revenant</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
and other of his poems, has presented the Christ as a modern
city vagrant suffering the buffets of modern society.</p>

<p>This fashion of bringing the Christian story up to date by introducing
the Christ into the life of the period has invaded painting
as well as poetry and the drama. Practised by Dagnan-Bouveret
from motives solely artistic,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> by L&eacute;on L&#8217;Hermitte, Pierre Lagarde,
and a number of others from motives partly artistic and partly
humanitarian, by the <i>mondain</i> Jean B&eacute;raud (<i>Chemin de la Croix</i>,
<i>Descente de la Croix</i>, <i>La Madeleine chez le Pharisien</i>, and
<i>Le Christ Li&eacute; &agrave; la Colonne</i>) out of what seems to be sheer
sensationalism, and by the decorators of the <i>cabarets artistiques
et litt&eacute;raires</i> of Montmartre, half out of a bravado which those
who cannot distinguish between religion and the church misname
blasphemy and half out of class hatred, it has also been practised
with unalloyed reverence and conviction by a number of
painters as a direct and undisguised form of revolutionary propaganda.
These last, perceiving that Christ, in the person of his
unfortunate children, is mocked, spit upon, and crucified every
day, and that a Magdalen is treated with no more consideration
by the scribes and Pharisees of the twentieth century than by
the scribes and Pharisees of the first century, have given us Christs
watching by the sick-beds of <i>cocottes</i>; Christs in corduroys and
sabots, fraternising with peasants; Christs in the garb of the Paris
labourer, exhorting in wine-shops and anarchist meetings; tatterdemalion
Christs, pleading vainly for alms in city streets and
along the country roads; peace-proclaiming Christs, jeered at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and pommelled by militarist mobs; and vagabond Christs, &#8220;without
legal domiciles,&#8221; brutalised by the police and hauled into the
courts.</p>

<p>It is among the &#8220;<i>dessinateurs</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> however, that the tendency
to utilise the Christ for purposes of revolutionary propaganda
is the most in evidence. Indeed, it is among the <i>dessinateurs</i>
(who are often painters likewise) that the spirit of revolt all along
the line is the most pronounced.</p>

<p>An average Parisian, if asked to name the <i>dessinateurs</i> most
in the public view, will cite for you Forain, Caran d&#8217;Ache, L&eacute;andre,
Guillaume, Cappiello, Sem, Abel Faivre, Steinlen, Willette, and
Hermann-Paul.</p>

<p>Sem portrays relentlessly the rottenness of society, but draws
no conclusions therefrom; Cappiello has no social significance,
whatever his artistic significance may be; and Guillaume, who
produces captivating <i>demi-mondaines</i> by the yard, has little more
social significance, although as illustrator he has cleverly seconded
Court&eacute;line in poking good-natured fun at the army.</p>

<p>Caran d&#8217;Ache gives himself by preference to gleeful satire
of the follies, frailties, and foibles of the time; but he can be tragic
and redoubtable, when he chooses, in the denunciation of its injustices
and crimes.</p>

<p>Abel Faivre, who is very much the sort of a caricaturist one
fancies Rubens might have been, had Rubens taken to caricature,
is slowly, but surely, justifying his seemingly gratuitous grossness
by evidences of an uncommon insight into human nature
and of a far-reaching philosophical purpose.</p>

<p>L&eacute;andre, charming, canny, and critical, easily first of living portrait-caricaturists,
amuses himself and his constituency hugely with
the imbecilities, vanities, and idiosyncrasies of public men, particularly
of parliamentarians. He was one of the illustrators
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
of the <i>Feuilles de Zo d&#8217;Axa</i>, and contributes irregularly to the anti-bourgeois
sheets, but does not appear to be an unequivocal social
revolutionist.</p>

<p>Forain, a consummate synthesiser, who can express more with
a minimum of strokes than any Frenchman living, at the beginning
of his career was a fierce exposer of the emptiness and crookedness
of politicians, financiers, and swells, and a convincing
pleader for justice to the oppressed. His sympathies have gone
out to the people more rarely since. With prosperity he has
become something of a swell himself, but he still electrifies Paris
now and then with a drawing whose poignancy shows plainly
that his heart has not shifted its position. Crueler than L&eacute;andre,&mdash;cruelest,
in fact, of all the men of his profession,&mdash;he is more
dreaded by the politicians than any other artist in Paris. As a
partisan of anti-Semitism, Forain has latterly directed most of
his political caricatures against those whom he considers, rightly
or wrongly, to be the tools of the Jews.</p>

<p>Hermann-Paul, Steinlen, and Willette<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> are out-and-out social
revolutionists.</p>

<p>Hermann-Paul provides all the illustrations for <i>L&#8217;Officiel</i>,
which &#8220;does not pretend,&#8221; says its editor Franc-Nohain, &#8220;to
be funnier than the <i>Journal Officiel</i> of the French Republic.&#8221;
He was an illustrator of the <i>Feuilles de Zo d&#8217;Axa</i>, and has participated
in the pictorial propaganda of <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i>.
He was one of the fiercest attackers of the army during the Dreyfus
affair, and his specialty&mdash;if a man of such a wide range of antipathies
as he may be said to have a specialty&mdash;is the exposure of
the horrors of war. The military atrocities which have been perpetrated
during the last few years, and which are still being perpetrated
in various quarters of the globe, have in him an ungullible
and indefatigable antagonist.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span></p>

<p>Willette&#8217;s grace is proverbial. In his lighter moods he is, with
a large allowance of course, a sort of modern Boucher or Watteau.
He is prodigal to the last degree of dainty nymphs and
goddesses and all manner of delicate nudities, of playful elves,
sprites, and cupids, of swans and doves, of na&iuml;ve <i>porcelaine-de-Saxe</i>
shepherdesses, irresponsible fauns and wily satyrs, of lamb-like
gambols, young loves, and spring-time settings; while his
pale Pierrots and Pierrettes, disporting by the light of the moon
or pensively rhyming and serenading, are strangely insinuating
and enticing. His Parisian types&mdash;at once real and unreal&mdash;are
equally captivating. Willette takes a mischievous delight
in surrounding them with piquant, pagan genii, by way of symbols;
and, even when he leaves them quite alone, they belong less
to the Paris of the day and the hour, with all their saucy modernity,
than to the realm of fantasy. Nevertheless, he can be bitter,
vindictive, terrible. No one of his contemporaries, except Forain,
can be so awful; and no one, not even Forain, has so often frightened
the bourgeois out of their bourgeois wits. A few of his
fiercer cartoons deserve notice here:&mdash;</p>

<p>A starving miner holds a bloated employer at the mercy of his
pick, in the bottom of a mine-shaft, and claims his vengeance.</p>

<p>A wild-eyed figure, symbolising the proletariat, brandishes
a knife tragically, and cries, &#8220;<i>Je voudrais que la soci&eacute;t&eacute; n&#8217;e&ucirc;t
qu&#8217;une seule t&ecirc;te pour la lui couper d&#8217;un seul coup</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A nude woman, at once voluptuous and august, enthroned
before a guillotine, proclaims,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem padl3">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;<i>Je suis la Sainte D&eacute;mocratie,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>J&#8217;attends mes amants.</i>&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Pour la Prochaine Exposition</i>: A <i>sans-culotte</i>, saucily puffing
a cigarette, displays a guillotine of the most approved pattern,
with this comment, &#8220;<i>Et elle sera &agrave; vapeur, mon bourgeois!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Marquis Talons-Rouges</i>: De Gallifet, &#8220;the butcher of the
Commune,&#8221; stands transfixed with terror while the massacred
rise up against him from under the paving-stones.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vendredi Saint</i>: M. B&eacute;renger,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> attired as a Protestant clergyman,
glowers at the Magdalen, who is weeping over the Crucified
One, and says, &#8220;<i>Si j&#8217;avais &eacute;t&eacute; de ces temps, il n&#8217;y aurait pas
eu de scandale au pied de la croix</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Willette is not tenderer with his bewitching
dreamland lovers than he is with the abused and the oppressed.</p>

<p>He has contributed to nearly all the illustrated organs of revolt,
beginning with the <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>, and at one time made all the illustrations
for a most impertinent little sheet, known as <i>Le Pied
de Nez</i>, the text for which was furnished by Camille St. Croix.
His stained-glass window at the <i>Chat Noir</i>, representing the
worship of the golden calf and bearing the inscription &#8220;<i>Te Deum
Laudamus</i>,&#8221; will be remembered as long as the <i>Chat Noir</i> itself.</p>

<p>Steinlen&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> work is big,&mdash;big for its humanity and big for its
art; big by reason of its realism and by reason of its idealism;
big in extent, intent, and content. His compositions possess
all the essential qualities of great pictures; and, if it is ever permitted
to class a simple <i>dessinateur</i> with the masters, Steinlen
must surely be ranked as one of the few great artists of his time.</p>

<p>In Steinlen we have all the social types that the <i>chansonnier</i>
Bruant and the monologist Jehan Rictus have made vivid
by their poetry, and a great many more besides; all the social
types that the painters of the humble&mdash;L&#8217;Hermitte, Raffaelli,
Sabatt&eacute;, and Besson&mdash;have endeared to us on canvas, and a
great many more besides: <i>maquereaux</i> and their white slaves,
the <i>filles du trottoir</i>; criminals, child-martyrs, country and city
vagabonds, and parasitic squatters on vacant city lots; coster-mongers
and street musicians; little dressmakers and milliners
tripping jauntily down the slopes of Montmartre and Belleville;
laundresses pounding and gossiping in the wash-houses or wearily
traversing the streets, with heavy baskets of clothes on their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
arms; Bohemian poets and artists fighting poverty in their humble
<i>m&eacute;nages</i> or junketing with their mistresses and models; over-dressed
<i>filles de joie</i> awaiting, Dana&euml;-like, in caf&eacute;s and night
restaurants, the descent of the golden shower; unsophisticated
or hungry working-girls falling into the traps set by the mistresses
of the public houses, and country maidens succumbing
to the glitter of the soldier&#8217;s coat; toiling peasants, stupid, stolid,
and patient; labourers and mechanics at their work, at their
noon-day luncheons, and, in the wine-shops after their working
hours, under the spell of prating politicians; miners grovelling
in the murk or marching, pale, starving, and ominous, as strikers,
to the assertion of their rights and the redress of their wrongs.
The painter Luce and the sculptor Meunier are, perhaps, the only
artists who have displayed continuously, during a series of years,
an equal comprehension of the suffering, the yearning, and the
revolt of the masses; and Meunier&#8217;s field of observation is scarcely
as broad as Steinlen&#8217;s, while Luce&#8217;s technical skill is inferior to
his. Steinlen has climbed by the ladder of a marvellous intuition
into the very soul of the proletariat, and his superb gift of
expression enables him to bear completest witness to all that he
has therein felt and seen.</p>

<p>A mighty sadness permeates his work.</p>

<p>Steinlen&#8217;s best-known drawings have appeared in <i>Le P&egrave;re
Peinard</i>, <i>Le Chambard</i>, <i>Le Mirliton</i>, <i>La Lanterne</i>, the anarchist
child&#8217;s paper <i>Jean-Pierre</i>, <i>Les Feuilles de Zo d&#8217;Axa</i>, <i>Le Canard
Sauvage</i>, <i>Le Sifflet</i>, and <i>Le Gil Blas Illustr&eacute;</i>, to which last he
contributed a first page, weekly, for a number of years. He
has illustrated two volumes of the <i>Chansons</i> of Bruant (<i>Dans
la Rue</i>) and Maurice Boukay&#8217;s <i>Chansons Rouges</i>. Several of
his posters, notably that of the socialist daily, <i>Le Petit Sou</i>,
breathe a fierce revolutionary spirit.</p>

<p>Among the minor <i>dessinateurs</i>&mdash;minor not necessarily in talent,
but in vogue&mdash;are the revolutionists Luce, Francis Jourdain,
Vallotton, Pissarro <i>fils</i>, Signac, Rysselberghe, and Ibels, already
noticed as painters. Roubille, G. Maurin, Jehannet, Guillaume,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Barbottin, Anquetin, Cross, Mab, Mabel, Lebasque, Delannoy,
Comin-Ache, Chevalier, Daumont, Alexandre Charpentier, Heidbrinck,
Camille Lef&egrave;vre, and J. Henault have been identified
with the propaganda by art of <i>Les Temps Nouveaux</i>. Couturier<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
has an intimate connection with the other anarchist organ, <i>Le
Libertaire</i>. Jean Grave&#8217;s primer of anarchy, <i>Les Aventures
de Nono</i>, was illustrated by Charpentier, Heidbrinck, Hermann-Paul,
Camille Lef&egrave;vre, Luce, Mab, Rysselberghe, and Pissarro
<i>fils</i>. Grandjouan, L&eacute;al de Camara, Arthur Micha&euml;l, Jossot,
Dubuc, Balluriau, Gottlob, No&euml;l Dorville, Jouve, Kupka, Weiluc,
Louis Morin, Braun, Borgex, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cadel, Darbour,
Roedel, Redon, and Gr&uuml;n are all strongly revolutionary in portions
of their work.</p>

<p><i>Le Rire</i>, <i>Le Sourire</i>, <i>Le Cri de Paris</i>, <i>Le Gil Blas Illustr&eacute;</i>,
and nearly a score of illustrated sheets, whose existence is likely
to be so ephemeral that their enumeration would be idle, allow
a modicum of space to refractory productions by these <i>dessinateurs</i>;
and in the spring of 1901 an illustrated publication was
founded, which is devoted exclusively to full-page drawings of
an anti-capitalistic, anti-governmental character. This publication,
which is called <i>L&#8217;Assiette au Beurre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> is as fierce in its
way as was the suppressed <i>P&egrave;re Peinard</i>. Several of its numbers
have been seized; but it has so far escaped complete suppression,&mdash;mainly,
it is likely, by reason of an entire absence of
reading-matter, it being far more difficult for the courts to define
the offence contained in an inflammatory drawing than the
offence contained in an inflammatory text. The prospectus of
<i>L&#8217;Assiette au Beurre</i> thus explains its aim: &#8220;We have arrived
at a turning-point in history, where it becomes necessary for a
publication which addresses itself to thinkers and artists to face
the social question under its most diverse aspects. Now is it
not a duty to combat by art the possessors of the <i>assiette au beurre</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
and all social iniquities? And how can it be done better than by
the pictorial presentation which fixes an idea in the brain with
an energy to which the effort of the most puissant writer cannot
attain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Practically all the <i>dessinateurs</i> heretofore mentioned have
appeared with greater or less frequency in <i>L&#8217;Assiette au Beurre</i>;

No other existing journal of caricature has made so comprehensive
an artistic effort;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> and it is at least a curious commentary&mdash;not
to insist farther&mdash;on the social attitude of the artistic <i>&eacute;lite</i>
that no other journal of caricature is so unequivocally revolutionary
in tone.</p>

<p>Daumier, the father of modern French caricature and the
greatest of French caricaturists, was scarcely tenderer in his
drawings to the exploiters of the poor, to bourgeois stupidity
and sham, and to courts, lawyers, and politicians, than are the
Mirbeaus, Tailhades, Jean Graves, and Kropotkines in their
writings; and in this respect (ignoring, of course, the question
of talent) he is closely resembled by a majority of his successors.
To be sure, it is easy to attach too much weight to this fact. The
caricaturist, like many another fellow who has to get his living
by his wits, does not invariably make it a point to express his
own convictions. The caricaturist, furthermore, could not consistently
accept a Utopia if he succeeded in ushering one in,
since in Utopia he would have no excuse for being. &#8220;Caricature
is, in the nature of the case, of the opposition.&#8221; But it is one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
thing to be of the opposition&mdash;that is, to assail the political element
in power&mdash;and quite another thing to demolish the state
itself and all the institutions of society. And it is this latter
thing that the great body of contemporary French caricaturists are
attempting to do.</p>

<p>Bernard Shaw in a little book of almost diabolical cleverness,
<i>The Perfect Wagnerite</i>, has advanced the rather startling theory
that no one can comprehend the Wagner music-dramas who
is not something of an anarchist.</p>

<p>Whatever one may think of Bernard Shaw in general, of Bernard
Shaw as a musical critic in particular, and, still more in
particular, of Bernard Shaw as a Wagner interpreter, one must
admit that there is always a half-truth, at least, lurking somewhere
about his Sibylline epigrams and paradoxes. There is
no questioning the fact that Wagner, the transformer of music,
was a professor of revolutionary doctrines, and that he incorporated,
deliberately or otherwise, the essence of these revolutionary
doctrines into his work. &#8220;During three years,&#8221; in the early part
of his career, &#8220;he kept pouring forth pamphlets on social evolution,
religion, life, art, and the influence of riches&#8221;; and one
of these pamphlets, <i>Art and Revolution</i>, is esteemed an anarchist
text-book by anarchists in all parts of the world. &#8220;What man,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;can, with lightness of heart and calm senses, plunge
his regard to the bottom of this world of murder and rapine,
organised and legalised by deceit, imposture, and hypocrisy,
without being obliged to avert his eyes with a shudder of disgust?&#8221;
Wagner resigned in 1849 his position as conductor of
the opera at Dresden in order to become &#8220;a leader of the people
in the revolution then under way.&#8221; He appealed to the king of
Saxony &#8220;to espouse the people&#8217;s cause, and then threw in his
lot with the people.&#8221; He was publicly proclaimed &#8220;a politically
dangerous person along with Bakounine and Roeckel,&#8221;&mdash;the
same Bakounine who is held the father of modern anarchism.</p>

<p>In France, as in Germany, the tendency of music during the
last fifty years has been towards a greater and greater liberty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
of form; and most of the notable contemporary French composers&mdash;with
the exception of Reyer, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and Massenet<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
(who represent, with modifications, the classic tradition), and
two or three ardent disciples of Gluck&mdash;proceed, more or less
directly, either from Wagner or from that other innovator, Hector
Berlioz (sometimes called the French Wagner), who was not, it
is true, a revolutionist in the political sense, but who was bitter
to the last degree against the society that stupidly refused to acknowledge
his power.</p>

<p>The writer is not enough of a musical connoisseur to trace the
transformations wrought in musical forms by French composers
since the time of Berlioz,&mdash;by C&eacute;sar Franck (who in a sense, however,
stood apart from the currents), by Pierre Lalo, Isidore de
Lara, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d&#8217;Indy, Camille Erlanger, DeBussy,
Gabriel Faur&eacute;, Leroux, Le Borne, Bourgault-Ducoudray,
Gustave Charpentier, and Alfred Bruneau; still less to point
out where these changes have been co-ordinated, as they were in
Wagner, with revolutionary thinking,&mdash;a task for which not only
musical connoisseurship, but the temperament of a musician,
the knowledge of an adept, and the intellect of a philosopher
would be required. But in two of the composers just named,
Alfred Bruneau and Gustave Charpentier, the co-ordination is so
obvious that &#8220;he who runs&#8221; (he of the average lay intelligence)
&#8220;may read,&#8221; since they are engaged in disseminating the idea of
liberty among the people.</p>

<p>Both have been influenced by Wagner, but both depart from
Wagner in taking their subjects, not from legends, but from
contemporary life, and the most ordinary every-day sort of
life at that.</p>

<p>Bruneau claims as large privileges for the composer of opera
as are accorded to the author, the painter, and the dramatist; the
same openness to passion, movement, and humanity, and the
same range of choice as regards characters, language, and setting.
&#8220;It is the right of the composer&#8221;&mdash;I quote from Bruneau&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
<i>Musique d&#8217;Hier et de Demain</i>&mdash;&#8220;to unite in a piece of his choosing
any beings he pleases, to place these beings in the human <i>milieu</i>
to which he considers they belong, and to put in their mouths the
words which he considers appropriate.... He must insist on
liberty of the dialogue, developing itself, without constraint of any
sort, upon the woof of the instrumentation, and forming one body
with it; liberty of the symphony, never interrupted, trumpeting,
rumbling, swelling, subsiding, with the necessities of the drama;
liberty of expression, more important still,&mdash;justness in the word
and precision in the term; liberty unlimited of the melody, tripping,
alert, grave, proud, tender, vigorous, joyous, surely, at being
able to escape from the imprisonment of the cadence and the
rhyme; liberty of the phrase, liberty of inspiration, liberty of art,
liberty of form, liberty complete, magnificent, and definitive!&#8221;</p>

<p>In <i>Messidor</i><a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> and <i>L&#8217;Attaque du Moulin</i> (prose librettos by Emile
Zola) Bruneau deals with strikes and the labour question so frankly
that it is not a little surprising that they were allowed a place
on a national stage. These works are appreciated by the critics,
but have not been, in spite of their popular subjects, signal popular
successes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Charpentier&#8217;s opera of <i>Louise</i> (produced at
the <i>Op&eacute;ra Comique</i> in 1899, and not yet banished from a prominent
place in the r&eacute;pertoire) has rapidly made the tour of France and
of Europe. <i>Louise</i>, which treats with a bizarre blending of realism
and idealism the life of the Bohemians and labourers of Montmartre,
may be said to mark an epoch in opera, in that it is the
first work of the French school which, having combined innovation
of musical form with innovation of subject and language,
has achieved a striking and permanent artistic and popular success.</p>

<p>With <i>Louise</i> the modern music-drama becomes, like the simple
drama, an appreciable force in direct revolutionary propaganda.
It is true that everything savouring of politics is scrupulously
excluded from the libretto of <i>Louise</i>, but this scrupulousness (absolutely
indispensable in a piece prepared for a subsidised stage)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
does not prevent the opera from being an unmistakable protest
against the social tyranny which is intrenched in the texts of the
law. Indeed, Charpentier, whose fine social fervour has been
evidenced in a variety of ways which may not be gone into here,
has publicly proclaimed his belief &#8220;in the efficacy of revolutions
well prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is more than a coincidence that the revolutionary Zola should
have been a zealous defender of the art of Courbet, of Manet,
of Monet, Pissarro, and Cezanne, and that a pronounced anarchist
like Octave Mirbeau should have been an early admirer
of Wagner, the introducer to France of Maeterlinck, the chief
champion of Monet, and an apotheosiser of Rodin,&mdash;should
have been, in short, the foster-father of the <i>irr&eacute;guliers</i> in every
department of art. He would be a surpassingly subtle analyser
and a masterful synthesiser who could establish the connection
between polyphonic orchestration, impressionism in painting and
sculpture and the <i>vers libre</i>, and between each and all of these
and the anarchistic philosophy,&mdash;between revolt against academicism
in the arts and revolt against the state; and yet no one
who observes ever so little can doubt that the connection exists.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">T</span>HE wisest words, probably, that were ever heard in a
court-room were uttered by Gamaliel, the Pharisee, at
the trial of Peter and John: &#8220;Refrain from these men,
and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men,
it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow
it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.&#8221;</p>

<p>To a similar purport, Montaigne wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Tis a very great presumption to slight and condemn all
things for false that do not appear to us likely to be true, which
is the ordinary vice of such as fancy themselves wiser than their
neighbours. I was myself once one of these; and if I heard talk
of dead folks walking, of prophecies, enchantments, witchcrafts,
or any other story, I had no mind to believe.... I presently pitied
the poor people that were abused by these follies, whereas
I now find that I myself was to be pitied as much at least as they;
not that experience has taught me anything to supersede my
former opinions, though my curiosity has endeavoured that way;
but reason has instructed me that thus resolutely to condemn
anything for false and impossible is to circumscribe and limit
the will of God and the power of nature within the bounds of
my own capacity, than which no folly can be greater. If we give
the names of monster and miracle to everything our reason cannot
comprehend, how many such are continually presented before
our eyes! Let us but consider through what clouds and,
as it were, groping through what darkness, our teachers lead
us to the knowledge of most of the things we apply our studies
to, and we shall find that it is rather custom than knowledge
that takes away the wonder, and renders them easy and familiar
to us; ... and that, if those things were now newly presented
to us, we should think them as strange and incredible, if not more
so, than others.... He that had never seen a river imagined the
first he met with to be the sea, and the greatest things that have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
fallen within our knowledge we conclude to be the extremes that
nature makes of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>To have pondered and appropriated these words of the far-sighted
Pharisee and the sage of P&eacute;rigord is to have stricken
the word <i>impossible</i> from one&#8217;s vocabulary, to have lost the desire
to emit shrieks of anger or dismay before new views of life and
society, and, without &#8220;mockings or arguments,&#8221; to simply &#8220;witness
and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>The philosophic doubt which no one more than Montaigne
has approved&mdash;the &#8220;<i>Que s&ccedil;ais-je?</i>&#8221; which forbids the swearing
of unconditional allegiance to unproved theories&mdash;is, of course,
always in order; but doubt becomes most pernicious dogmatism
when it assumes the r&ocirc;le of denial. It plays its proper part when,
and only when, it produces a willingness to &#8220;leave great changes,&#8221;
as Stevenson happily puts it, &#8220;to what we call great blind forces,
their blindness being so much more perspicacious than the little
peering, partial eyesight of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>La folie d&#8217;hier est la sagesse de demain</i>&#8221; has been said so long,
and accepted so long, that there is no tracing it to its origin;
and yet we go on diligently disregarding it, seizing every fresh
occasion to &#8220;kick against the pricks,&#8221; quite as if the stupidity
of the practice had not been demonstrated a thousand times
over, quite as if the stones rejected by the builders had never
become the heads of the corners, and the first had never been
last, and the last first.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we came from a globe where there was some semblance

of our planet would appear to us a pure abomination.&#8221; In the
interests of clearness, M. Clemenceau has exaggerated, perhaps.
Nevertheless, there is an element of truth in what he says. Our
society is abundantly open to criticism; and that we chance to
be inimical to panaceas and suspicious of Utopias is no valid
reason for calling the black of our society white, and blandly treating
its absurdities, illogicalities, injustices, and cruelties as infallibilities
and amenities. Because the reformer commits the folly
of dogmatising in one direction does not excuse us for committing
the counter-folly of dogmatising in another. Suppose we hold

<p>When Victor Barrucand, a few years ago, put forward his
scheme for free bread (&#8220;<i>le pain gratuit</i>&#8221;), he was not treated
as a visionary in any important quarter. The semi-bourgeois
journals showed themselves, in several instances, rather friendly;
and the opposition he encountered from the straight bourgeois
press was of quite a different sort from that which is evoked by
a preposterous proposition. M. Clemenceau, one of the few
radicals who has never for a moment lost his balance, supported
him warmly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It is high time we knew,&#8221; said Clemenceau, &#8220;whether,
at the degree of civilisation to which we have attained, we can
continue to tolerate that men, women, and children die of want&mdash;in
a few months from the exhaustion induced by insufficiently
remunerated work or in a few hours from downright hunger.
Our republican and monarchical conservatives&mdash;all excellent Christians&mdash;answer,
&#8216;No,&#8217; but continue to act &#8216;Yes.&#8217;... I just remarked
that M. Barrucand did not propose revolution to us. I
ask myself now if I did not go a bit too fast. Yes, eighteen
hundred years after the Christ, it is a revolution for Christians to
prevent the death of their fellows by slow and rapid starvation.
Well, then, let us inaugurate this revolution!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Le pain gratuit c&#8217;est le futur</i>,&#8221; said Jules Lermina at the
same moment. And, really, is it so unreasonable that every
one should be given enough to eat, when slaves have been, and
domestic animals are, so provided for, and when every one is
given the privilege of learning to read and write? Is it not rather
surprising that a person should be permitted, nay, forced, to acquire
reading and writing, and should be supplied at the public
expense (without apparent opposition from any source) with fresh
air, lights, pure water, paved streets, and parks, and should
not be provided with bread; that he is entitled to food inspection
and is not entitled to food itself; that he is assured proper disposition
for his waste and is not assured a sufficiency of supply;
that he can count on a burial and cannot count&mdash;supreme irony!&mdash;on
a living; has the right to a grave-plot and has not the right to
a loaf? Is illiteracy so much more dangerous to society than
destitution? Is everything as merry as it might be when death
thus lords it over life; when a man asks for bread, and is given
a coffin?</p>

<p>A republic with manhood suffrage and generally disseminated
book-knowledge would probably have seemed as chimerical to
the minds of our not very remote ancestors as the community of
the socialist or anarchist dream seems to us. It would not be
more remarkable if wage-earners should disappear than it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
that serfs and slaves disappeared; if the factory system should
disappear than it was that it once appeared; if alms-giving
should be replaced by a recognition of the right to work than
that charity from being a fine, spontaneous human impulse has
become an unwieldy, soulless machine; if private property should
be transformed into collective property than that private property
was evolved out of the tribal possessions; if the church should
cease to be an institution of the state&mdash;indeed it has already
ceased to be in America&mdash;than that it ever became one; if
<i>l&#8217;union libre</i> should supersede marriage (with the loss of the
latter&#8217;s chief sanctions, private property and the already much-enfeebled
authority of the church) than that monogamy has
superseded polygamy; if woman should be emancipated than
that man has, up to a certain point, been emancipated. Furthermore,
it would be no more extraordinary if the <i>tiers &eacute;tat</i> (the
present dominant <i>bourgeoisie</i>) should be evicted by the <i>quatri&egrave;me
&eacute;tat</i> (the proletariat) than it was that the <i>tiers &eacute;tat</i> evicted the
nobility and clergy in 1789; if a social republic (under which
without knowing or, at least, without admitting it we are already
half installed) should follow close upon the heels of a simple
republic than that a simple republic followed close upon the
heels of a monarchy and a monarchy close upon the heels of a
feudal system; if nations should pass as political entities by being
merged in an <i>Internationale</i> than that they emerged out of the
seeming chaos of the Middle Ages; if there should be one tongue
over all the earth<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> than that there has come to be one tongue
over any entire people; if there should be general peace than
that there has been general war.</p>

<p>No, there is nothing inherently incredible or absurd about the
ideas and ideals of the contemporary revolutionists; nothing
more transcendental or more visionary than there was, for their
day and their generation, in the ideas and ideals of the
Encyclopedists, and of the innovators and reformers of all
the past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>It may have been a mistake for the classes to impose book-learning
on the masses, to compel them to eat the fruit of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil, which makes men as gods;
but, having given their wards to eat thereof, having deliberately
stimulated them to think, the privileged must let them follow
out their thinking to the logical&mdash;perhaps, also, to the bitter&mdash;end.
There is no alternative. There is no such thing as staying them
midway in their course, since with growing knowledge has come
growing desire.</p>

<p>If the classes did not wish the masses to drink deep of the
Pierian spring, they should have had the sense to keep them away
from it altogether instead of ingenuously leading them up to
sip. As it is, the people have become mentally and morally
incapable of blind submission. They cannot be hoodwinked
by fine phrases as of yore. Their roused and trained intelligence
is rapidly penetrating the shams, puncturing the frauds, and stripping
off the shows of republicanism. They will not much longer
be put off with the mere forms and formulas of liberty and well-being
which satisfied them at the start. They are now beginning
to demand the things themselves, and they have at last the
minds and the manhood necessary to enforce their demand.
The illogical, hypocritical, plutocratic republic which they find
themselves under disgusts and exasperates them quite as much
as would a monarchy. They have resolved to have out-and-out
democracy instead of the miserable makeshift for democracy
that has been thrown to them as a sop; and have it they will!
<i>Gare &agrave; vous</i>, na&iuml;ve, short-sighted bourgeois, who with your reading
and writing started them on their quest for the new, if you
attempt to place obstructions in their path!</p>

<p>The people have a startling way of getting, in the long run,
the specific things they set their hearts on. And one may admit&mdash;without
the slightest prejudice to his intellectual independence
or the slightest abdication of his preferences&mdash;that the specific
things the revolutionists of Paris and the world at large are striving
for may sooner or later be theirs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>A successful social revolution, one day or another, is neither
an inconceivable, an impossible, nor even an improbable event.
The time may come, at least for all that we can reasonably affirm
to the contrary, when there will be no more governments, no more
great fortunes, no more private property, no more poverty, no
more &#8220;marrying and giving in marriage,&#8221; no more wars, no more
armies, no more patriotism, and no more diversity of tongues.</p>

<p>This is not saying that the individual life will be fuller, richer,
and sweeter then than it has been and is, nor that the world
will be enormously better and happier than it is and has been.
Apples of the most golden seeming have been known to turn to
ashes in the plucker&#8217;s hand; and, when the time comes&mdash;if it does
come&mdash;that the revolutionists&#8217; present cravings have all been satisfied,
the millennium will still, in all likelihood, be as far as ever
away.</p>

<p>Change, incessant change, is the law of the universe; but change,
though inevitable, and hence never really bad and never really
to be regretted, is not synonymous with progress,&mdash;not in the sense,
at least, in which the latter word is generally understood.</p>

<p>It is as big a piece of dogmatism to be cock-sure the world is
growing better all the time and all along the line, simply because
it is perpetually changing, as it is to be cock-sure it is constantly
growing worse, and as big a piece of credulity to look forward
confidently to a Golden Age in the future as to revert&mdash;unhumorously&mdash;to
a Golden Age in the past. Every system of society
which has existed thus far is now admitted to have had its
qualities and its defects,&mdash;what is more, the defects of its qualities.
Our period of machinery, universal suffrage, and diffused book-knowledge
(factors from which our fathers expected miracles to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
spring) has its blemishes as well as the periods of illiteracy, blooded
aristocracy, and hand labour. Our new woman&mdash;we are reminded
every day&mdash;is as antipathetic and inept in some ways
as she is charming and useful in other ways; and, while we cannot
be sure that every future period will &#8220;depress some elements of
goodness just as much as it will encourage others,&#8221; we have,
alas! no adequate guarantee that it will not do so.</p>

<p>It may be that it is again to be the mission of France to redeem
(or appear to redeem) the world by a sort of vicarious atonement.
The cult of revolution is not dead there, and the impulse that
demolished the Bastille has by no means spent itself. Or it may
be that for Russia, where the provocation is greatest, or for America,
where there is most initiative and the most accelerated rate
of change, is reserved this fearsome r&ocirc;le. But, wherever the Social
Revolution begins and wherever it reaches, the well-balanced
man, who has won through stress and travail to a sane outlook
and to an enthusiasm for life; he who can say with Kipling&#8217;s

<p>Friendships and loves&mdash;the only things really worth while to
seasoned natures&mdash;have always been. Under all r&eacute;gimes, men
have had friends and sweethearts and little ones for the greater
glory of their souls; and friends and sweethearts and little ones&mdash;the
boldest innovators do not assert otherwise&mdash;they are likely
to have while time is.</p>

<p>These loves and these friendships have found such beautiful
expression already that there is little to hope from the future.

On the other hand, so far as they are concerned, there is nothing
to fear.</p>

<p>What matters, then, in the last analysis the march of public
events,&mdash;monarchy, republic, social republic, or anarchistic commune,&mdash;so
that we bear the brunt together, heart to heart, and the
great elemental things abide?</p>
